Financial and monetary conditions
Our monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions. 
Funding has again become more expensive for banks, as savers are replacing overnight deposits with  
 
time deposits that pay more interest and the ECBâ€™s targeted longer-term refinancing operations are 
being phased out. Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages continued to increase in 
July, to 4.9 per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively.  
Credit dynamics have weakened further. Loans to firms grew at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in July, 
down from 3.0 per cent in June. Loans to households also grew less strongly, by 1.3 per cent, after 1.7 
per cent in June. In annualised terms based on the last three months of data, household loans 
declined by 0.8 per cent, which is the strongest contraction since the start of the euro. Amid weak 
lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, the annual growth rate of M3 fell from 0.6 
per cent in June to an all-time low of -0.4 per cent in July. In annualised terms over the past three 
months, M3 contracted by 1.5 per cent.
