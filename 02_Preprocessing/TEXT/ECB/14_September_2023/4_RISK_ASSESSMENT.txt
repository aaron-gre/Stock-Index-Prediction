Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside. Growth could be slower if the effects of 
monetary policy are more forceful than expected, or if the world economy weakens , for instance owing 
to a further slowdown in China. Conversely, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour 
market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that people and businesses become more 
confident and spend more. 
Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food. 
Adverse weather conditions, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up 
by more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than 
anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the 
medium term. By contrast, weaker demand – for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary 
policy or a worsening of the economic environment outside the euro area – would lead to lower price 
pressures, especially over the medium term.
