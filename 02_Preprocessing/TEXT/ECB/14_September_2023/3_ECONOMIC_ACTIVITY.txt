Economic activity
The economy is likely to remain subdued in the coming months. It broadly stagnated over the first half 
of the year, and recent indicators suggest it has also been weak in the third quarter. Lower demand for 
the euro area’s exports and the impact of tight financing conditions are dampening growth, including 
through lower residential and business investment. The services sector, which had so far been 
resilient, is now also weakening. Over time, economic momentum should pick up, as real incomes are 
expected to rise, supported by falling inflation, rising wages and a strong labour market, and this will 
underpin consumer spending.  
The labour market has so far remained resilient despite the slowing economy. The unemployment rate 
stayed at its historical low of 6.4 per cent in July. While employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the 
second quarter, momentum is slowing. The services sector, which has been a major driver of 
employment growth since mid-2022, is now also creating fewer jobs. 
As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures. 
This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for 
an even stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy 
more productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s 
supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU 
programme – can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green 
transition. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded before the 
end of this year and progress towards Capital Markets Union should be accelerated.
