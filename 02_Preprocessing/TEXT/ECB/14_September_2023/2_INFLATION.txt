Inflation
Inflation declined to 5.3 per cent in July but remained at that level in August, according to Eurostatâ€™s 
flash estimate. Its decline was interrupted because energy prices rose compared with July. Food price 
inflation has come down from its peak in March but was still almost 10 per cent in August. In the 
coming months, the sharp price increases recorded in the autumn of 2022 will drop out of the yearly 
rates, thus pulling inflation down.  
 
Inflation excluding energy and food fell to 5.3 per cent in August, from 5.5 per cent in July. Goods 
inflation declined to 4.8 per cent in August, from 5.0 per cent in July and 5.5 per cent in June, owing to 
better supply conditions, previous drops in energy prices, easing price pressures in the earlier stages 
of the production chain and weaker demand. Services inflation edged down to 5.5 per cent but was 
still kept up by strong spending on holidays and travel and by the high growth of wages. The annual 
growth rate of compensation per employee remained constant at 5.5 per cent in the second quarter of 
the year. The contribution of labour costs to annual domestic inflation increased in the second quarter, 
in part owing to weaker productivity, while the contribution of profits fell for the first time since early 
2022.  
Most measures of underlying inflation are starting to fall as demand and supply have become more 
aligned and the contribution of past energy price increases is fading out. At the same time, domestic 
price pressures remain strong. 
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent. But some 
indicators have increased and need to be monitored closely.
