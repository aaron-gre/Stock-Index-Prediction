Conclusion
Summing up, the Governing Council will stay the course in raising interest rates significantly at a 
steady pace and in keeping them at levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of 
inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Accordingly, we today decided to raise the three key 
ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and we expect to raise them further. In view of the underlying 
inflation pressures, we intend to raise interest rates by another 50 basis points at our next monetary 
policy meeting in March and we will then evaluate the subsequent path of our monetary policy. 
Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and 
will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, from the  
 
beginning of March 2023, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the 
Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.   
Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting by 
meeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
