Financial and monetary conditions
As we tighten monetary policy, market interest rates are rising further and credit to the private sector is 
becoming more expensive. Bank lending to firms has decelerated sharply over recent months. This 
partly stems from lower financing needs for inventories. But it also reflects weakening demand for 
loans to finance business investment, in the context of a steep upward move in bank lending rates and 
a considerable tightening in credit standards, which is also visible in our most recent bank lending 
survey. Household borrowing has continued to weaken as well, reflecting rising lending rates, tighter 
credit standards and a sharp fall in the demand for mortgages. As loan creation decelerates, money 
growth is also slowing rapidly, with a marked decline in its most liquid components, including overnight 
deposits, only partially compensated by a shift to term deposits.
