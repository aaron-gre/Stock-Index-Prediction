Risk assessment
The risks to the outlook for economic growth have become more balanced. Russiaâ€™s unjustified war 
against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy and could 
again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also be an additional drag on euro area 
growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than we expect. Moreover, the recovery would 
face obstacles if the pandemic were to re-intensify and cause renewed supply disruptions. However,  
 
the energy shock could fade away faster than anticipated and euro area companies could adapt more 
quickly to the challenging international environment. This would support higher growth than currently 
expected. 
The risks to the inflation outlook have also become more balanced, especially in the near term.  On the 
upside, existing pipeline pressures could still send retail prices higher in the near term. Moreover, a 
stronger than expected economic rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and 
foreign demand. Domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target 
or higher than anticipated wage rises could drive inflation higher, also over the medium term. On the 
downside, the recent fall in energy prices, if it persists, may slow inflation more rapidly than expected. 
This downward pressure in the energy component could then also translate into weaker dynamics for 
underlying inflation. A further weakening of demand would also contribute to lower price pressures 
than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.
