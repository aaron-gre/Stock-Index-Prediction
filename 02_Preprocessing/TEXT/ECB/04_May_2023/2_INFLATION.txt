Inflation
According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation was 7.0 per cent in April, after having dropped from 
8.5 per cent in February to 6.9 per cent in March. While base effects led to some increase in energy 
price inflation, from -0.9 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in April, the rate stands far below those 
recorded after the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Food price inflation remains elevated, 
however, standing at 13.6 per cent in April, after 15.5 per cent in March. 
Price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food was 5.6 per cent in April, having 
edged down slightly compared with March to return to its February level. Non-energy industrial goods 
inflation fell to 6.2 per cent in April, from 6.6 per cent in March, when it declined for the first time in 
several months. But services inflation increased to 5.2 per cent in April, from 5.1 per cent in March. 
Inflation is still being pushed up by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases and supply 
bottlenecks. In services, especially, it is still being pushed higher also by pent-up demand from the 
reopening of the economy and by rising wages. The information available up to March suggests that 
indicators of underlying inflation remain high.  
 
Wage pressures have strengthened further as employees, in a context of a robust labour market, 
recoup some of the purchasing power they have lost as a result of high inflation. Moreover, in some 
sectors firms have been able to increase their profit margins on the back of mismatches between 
supply and demand and the uncertainty created by high and volatile inflation. Although most measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, some indicators have 
edged up and warrant continued monitoring.
