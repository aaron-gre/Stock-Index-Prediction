Risk assessment
Renewed financial market tensions, if persistent, would pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth 
as they could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen confidence. 
Russia’s war against Ukraine also continues to be a significant downside risk to the economy. 
However, the recent reversal of past adverse supply shocks, if sustained, could spur confidence and 
support higher growth than currently expected. The continued resilience of the labour market, by 
bolstering household confidence and spending, could also lead to higher growth than anticipated.  
There are still significant upside risks to the inflation outlook. These include existing pipeline pressures 
that could send retail prices higher than expected in the near term. Moreover, Russia’s war against 
Ukraine could again push up the costs of energy and food. A lasting rise in inflation expectations 
above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive 
inflation higher, including over the medium term. Recent negotiated wage agreements have added to 
the upside risks to inflation, especially if profit margins remain high. The downside risks include 
renewed financial market tensions, which could bring inflation down faster than projected. Weaker 
demand, due for example to a more marked slowing of bank lending or a stronger transmission of 
monetary policy, would also lead to lower price pressures than currently anticipated, especially over 
the medium term.
