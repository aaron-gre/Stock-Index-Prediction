Financial and monetary conditions
The euro area banking sector has proved resilient in the face of the financial market tensions that 
arose ahead of our last meeting. Our policy rate increases are being transmitted strongly to risk-free 
interest rates and to the financing conditions for firms, households and banks. For firms and 
households, loan growth has weakened owing to higher borrowing rates, tighter credit supply 
conditions and lower demand. Our latest bank lending survey reported a tightening of overall credit 
standards, which was stronger than banks had expected in the previous round and suggests that 
lending may weaken further. Weak lending has meant that money growth has also continued to 
decline.
