Conclusion
Summing up, the inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high 
inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 
25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-
term inflation outlook that we formed at our previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over 
recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, our past rate 
increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the 
lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain. 
Our future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently res trictive to 
achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those 
levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining 
the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our policy rate decisions will continue to 
be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial 
data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmis sion. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
