Economic activity
The euro area economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to Eurostat’s 
preliminary flash estimate. Lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and fiscal policy  
 
support for firms and households have contributed to the resilience of the economy. At the same time, 
private domestic demand, especially consumption, is likely to have remained weak. 
Business and consumer confidence have recovered steadily in recent months but remain weaker than 
before Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people. We see a divergence across sectors of 
the economy. The manufacturing sector is working through a backlog of orders, but its prospects are 
worsening. The services sector is growing more strongly, especially owing to the reopening of the 
economy. 
Household incomes are benefiting from the strength of the labour market, with the unemployment rate 
falling to a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in March. Employment has continued to grow and total 
hours worked exceed pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the average number of hours worked 
remains somewhat below its pre-pandemic level and its recovery has stalled since mid-2022. 
As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and 
in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a 
stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy 
more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s 
supply capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium 
term. In this regard, we welcome the publication of the European Commission’s legislative proposals 
for the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework, which should be concluded soon.
