Economic activity
After five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent over the first quarter of 
2024. The services sector is expanding, and manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at low 
levels. We expect the economy to continue to recover as higher wages and improved terms of trade 
push up real incomes. Stronger exports should also support growth over the coming quarters, as 
global demand for goods and services rises. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on 
demand over time.  
Employment rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, with around 500,000 new jobs 
created, and surveys point to continued job growth in the near term. The unemployment rate edged 
down to 6.4 per cent in April, its lowest level since the start of the euro. Companies are still posting 
many job vacancies, though slightly fewer than before. 
National fiscal and structural policies should aim at making the economy more productive and 
competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium 
term. An effective, speedy and full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme, progress 
towards capital markets union and the completion of banking union, and a strengthening of the Single 
Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital transitions. 
Implementing the EUâ€™s revised economic governance framework fully and without delay will help 
governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis.
