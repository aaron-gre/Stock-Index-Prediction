Inflation
Annual inflation rose to 2.6 per cent in May, from 2.4 per cent in April, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash 
estimate. Food price inflation declined to 2.6 per cent. Energy price inflation increased to 0.3 per cent, 
after recording negative annual rates for a year. Goods price inflation continued to decrease in May, to 
0.8 per cent. By contrast, services price inflation rose markedly, to 4.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent in 
April.  
 
Most measures of underlying inflation declined further in April, the last month for which data are 
available, confirming the picture of gradually diminishing price pressures. However, domestic inflation 
remains high. Wages are still rising at an elevated pace, making up for the past inflation surge. Owing 
to the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process and the important role of one-off payments, 
labour costs will likely fluctuate over the near term, as seen in the pick-up in negotiated wages in the 
first quarter. At the same time, forward-looking indicators signal that wage growth will moderate over 
the course of the year. Profits are absorbing part of the pronounced rise in unit labour costs, which 
reduces its inflationary effects. 
Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, including due to energy-
related base effects. It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next 
year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive monetary policy, 
and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2 per cent.
