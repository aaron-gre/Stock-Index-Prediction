Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth are balanced in the near term but remain tilted to the downside over the 
medium term. A weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between major economies 
would weigh on euro area growth. Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in 
the Middle East are major sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households 
becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could also be lower 
if the effects of monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. Growth could be higher if inflation 
comes down more quickly than expected and rising confidence and real incomes mean that spending 
increases by more than anticipated, or if the world economy grows more strongly than expected.  
Inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. 
Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy 
prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather  
events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation 
may surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand more than expected, or if the 
economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.
