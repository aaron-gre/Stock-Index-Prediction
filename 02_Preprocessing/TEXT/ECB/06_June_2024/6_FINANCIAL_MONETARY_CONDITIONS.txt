Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have risen since our April meeting. Financing costs have plateaued at restrictive 
levels as our past policy rate increases have worked their way through the financial system. The  
 
average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages were unchanged in April, at 5.2 
per cent and 3.8 per cent respectively. 
Credit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in April, 
down slightly from the previous month. Loans to households continued to grow at 0.2 per cent on an 
annual basis. The annual growth in broad money – as measured by M3 – rose to 1.3 per cent in April, 
from 0.9 per cent in March. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient. The improving 
economic outlook has fostered financial stability, but heightened geopolitical risks cloud the horizon. 
An unexpected tightening of global financing conditions could prompt a repricing of financial and non-
financial assets, with negative effects on the wider economy. Macroprudential policy remains the first 
line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities. The measures that are currently in 
place or will soon take effect are helping to keep the financial system resilient.
