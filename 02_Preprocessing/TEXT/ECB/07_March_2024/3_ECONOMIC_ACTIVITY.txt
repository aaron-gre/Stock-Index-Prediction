Economic activity
The economy remains weak. Consumers continued to hold back on their spending, investment 
moderated and companies exported less, reflecting a slowdown in external demand and some losses 
in competitiveness. However, surveys point to a gradual recovery over the course of this year. As 
inflation falls and wages continue to grow, real incomes will rebound, supporting growth. In addition, 
the dampening impact of past interest rate increases will gradually fade and demand for euro area 
exports should pick up. 
The unemployment rate is at its lowest since the start of the euro. Employment grew by 0.3 per cent in 
the final quarter of 2023, again outpacing economic activity. As a result, output per person declined 
further. Meanwhile, employers are posting fewer job vacancies, while fewer firms are reporting that 
their production is being limited by labour shortages. 
Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures to allow the disinflation 
process to proceed sustainably. Fiscal and structural policies should be strengthened to make our 
economy more productive and competitive, expand supply capacity and gradually bring down high 
public debt ratios. A speedier implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and more 
determined efforts to remove national barriers to deeper and more integrated banking and capital 
markets can help increase investment in the green and digital transitions and reduce price pressures 
in the medium term. The EUâ€™s revised economic governance framework should be implemented 
without delay.
