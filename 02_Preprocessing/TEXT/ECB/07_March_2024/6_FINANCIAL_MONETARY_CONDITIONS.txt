Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have risen since our January meeting and our monetary policy has kept broader 
financing conditions restrictive. Lending rates on business loans have broadly stabilised, while 
mortgage rates declined in December and January. Nevertheless, lending rates remain elevated, at 
5.2 per cent for business loans and 3.9 per cent for mortgages.  
Bank lending to firms had turned positive in December, growing at an annual rate of 0.5 per cent. But, 
in January, it edged lower, to 0.2 per cent, owing to a negative flow in the month. The growth in loans 
to households continued to weaken, falling to 0.3 per cent on an annual basis in January. Broad 
money – as measured by M3 – grew at a subdued rate of 0.1 per cent.
