Inflation
Inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent in January and, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, declined 
further to 2.6 per cent in February. Food price inflation fell again, to 5.6 per cent in January and 4.0 
per cent in February, while energy prices in both months continued to decline compared with a year 
ago but at a lower rate than in December. Goods price inflation also fell further, to 2.0 per cent in 
January and 1.6 per cent in February. Services inflation, after remaining at 4.0 per cent for three 
months in a row, edged lower to 3.9 per cent in February.  
Most measures of underlying inflation declined further in January as the impact of past  supply shocks 
continued to fade and tight monetary policy weighed on demand. However, domestic price pressures 
are still elevated, in part owing to robust wage growth and falling labour productivity. At the same time, 
there are signs that growth in wages is starting to moderate. In addition, profits are absorbing part of 
the rising labour costs, which reduces the inflationary effects.   
 
Inflation is expected to continue this downward trend in the coming months. Further ahead, it is 
expected to decline to our target as labour costs moderate and the effects of past energy shocks, 
supply bottlenecks and the reopening of the economy after the pandemic fade. Measures of longer-
term inflation expectations remain broadly stable, with most standing around 2 per cent.
