Inflation
Inflation dropped to 4.3 per cent in September, almost a full percentage point lower than its August
level. In the near term, it is likely to come down further, as the sharp price increases in energy and
food recorded in autumn 2022 will drop out of the yearly rates. Septemberâ€™s decline was broad-based.
Food price inflation slowed again, although it remains high by historical standards. In annual terms,
energy prices fell by 4.6 per cent but, most recently, have risen again and become less predictable in
view of the new geopolitical tensions.
Inflation excluding energy and food dropped to 4.5 per cent in September, from 5.3 per cent in August.
This fall was supported by improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous declines in
energy prices, and the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power.
Goods and services inflation rates fell substantially, to 4.1 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively, with
services inflation also being pulled down by pronounced base effects. Price pressures in tourism and
travel appear to be moderating.
Most measures of underlying inflation continue to decline. At the same time, domestic price pressures
are still strong, reflecting also the growing importance of rising wages. Measures of longer-term
inflation expectations mostly stand around 2 per cent. Nonetheless, some indicators remain elevated
and need to be monitored closely.
