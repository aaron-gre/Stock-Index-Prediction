Financial and monetary conditions
Longer-term interest rates have risen markedly since our last meeting, reflecting strong increases in
other major economies. Our monetary policy continues to transmit strongly into broader financing
conditions. Funding has become more expensive for banks, and interest rates for business loans and
mortgages rose again in August, to 5.0 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively.
Higher borrowing rates, with the associated cuts in investment plans and house purchases, led to a
further sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey.
Moreover, credit standards for loans to firms and households tightened further. Banks are becoming
more concerned about the risks faced by their customers and are less willing to take on risks
themselves.
Against this background, credit dynamics have weakened further. The annual growth rate of loans to
firms has dropped sharply, from 2.2 per cent in July to 0.7 per cent in August and 0.2 per cent in
September. Loans to households remained subdued, with the growth rate slowing to 1.0 per cent in
August and 0.8 per cent in September. Amid weak lending and the reduction in the Eurosystem
balance sheet, the annual growth rate of M3 fell to -1.3 per cent in August – the lowest level recorded
since the start of the euro – and still stood at -1.2 per cent in September.
