The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. The
incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation
outlook. Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain

In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy
transmission.
We are now ready to take your questions.
