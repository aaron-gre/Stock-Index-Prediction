Inflation
Inflation came down further in June, reaching 5.5 per cent, after 6.1 per cent in May. Energy prices fell 
again, dropping by 5.6 per cent, year on year. Food price inflation continued to slow but remained 
high, at 11.6 per cent.  
Inflation excluding energy and food edged up to 5.5 per cent in June, with goods and services 
following diverging trends. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.5 per cent, from 5.8 per cent in May.  
 
Conversely, services inflation rose to 5.4 per cent, from 5.0 per cent in May, owing to robust spending 
on holidays and travel and also reflecting upward base effects.  
The drivers of inflation are changing. External sources of inflation are easing. By contrast, domestic 
price pressures, including from rising wages and still robust profit margins, are becoming an 
increasingly important driver of inflation.  
While some measures are moving lower, underlying inflation remains high overall, including owing to 
the persistent impact of past energy price increases on economy-wide prices. Although most 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators 
remain elevated and need to be monitored closely.
