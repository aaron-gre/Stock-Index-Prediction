Risk assessment
The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growth 
include Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensi ons, 
which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be 
slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than expected, or if the world economy 
weakens and thereby dampens demand for euro area exports. Conversely, growth could be higher 
than projected if the strong labour market, rising real incomes and receding uncertainty mean that 
people and businesses become more confident and spend more. 
Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, 
also related to Russia’s unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Adverse weather 
conditions, in light of the unfolding climate crisis, may push up food prices by more than projected. A 
lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated increases in wages or 
profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. By contrast, w eaker 
demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of monetary policy – would lead to lower price 
pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would come down faster if declining 
energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to the prices of other goods and 
services more quickly than currently anticipated.
