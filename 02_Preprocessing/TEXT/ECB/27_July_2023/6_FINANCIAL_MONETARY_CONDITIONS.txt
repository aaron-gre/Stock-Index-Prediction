Financial and monetary conditions
Our monetary policy tightening continues to be transmitted strongly to broader financing conditions. 
Risk-free interest rates over short to medium-term maturities have increased since our last meeting 
and funding has become more expensive for banks, in part owing to the ongoing phasing-out of the  
 
ECBâ€™s targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). The large TLTRO repayment in June 
went smoothly, as banks were well prepared. Average lending rates for business loans and mortgages 
rose again in May, to 4.6 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively.  
Higher borrowing rates and the associated cuts in spending plans led to a further sharp drop in credit 
demand in the second quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. Moreover, credit 
standards for loans to firms and households tightened further, as banks are becoming more 
concerned about the risks faced by their customers and are less willing to bear these risks. Tighter 
financing conditions are also making housing less affordable and less attractive as an investment , and 
demand for mortgages has dropped for the fifth quarter in a row. 
Against this background, the annual growth rate of lending continued to decrease in June, falling to 
3.0 per cent for firms and 1.7 per cent for households, with annualised growth rates of 0.0 per cent 
and -0.2 per cent in the second quarter respectively. Amid weak lending and the reduction in the 
Eurosystem balance sheet, the annual growth rate of broad money fell to 0.6 per cent in June, with an 
annualised growth rate of -1.1 per cent in the second quarter.
