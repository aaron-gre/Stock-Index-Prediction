Conclusion
Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. The Governing 
Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. 
Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive 
levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium- term 
target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and 
duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our 
assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics 
of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
