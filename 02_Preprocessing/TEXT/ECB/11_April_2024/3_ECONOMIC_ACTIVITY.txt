Economic activity
The economy remained weak in the first quarter. While spending on services is resilient, 
manufacturing firms are facing weak demand and production is still subdued, especially in energy-
intensive sectors. Surveys point to a gradual recovery over the course of this year, led by services. 
This recovery is expected to be supported by rising real incomes, resulting from lower inflation,  
 
increased wages and improved terms of trade. In addition, the growth of euro area exports should pick 
up over the coming quarters, as the global economy recovers and spending shifts further towards 
tradables. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time.  
The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the start of the euro. At the same time, the tightness 
in the labour market continues to gradually decline, with employers posting fewer job vacancies. 
Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures so that disinflation can 
proceed sustainably. Implementing the EUâ€™s revised economic governance framework fully and 
without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis. 
National fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive and 
competitive, which would help to reduce price pressures in the medium term. At the European level, 
an effective and speedy implementation of the Next Generation EU programme and a strengthening of 
the Single Market would help foster innovation and increase investment in the green and digital 
transitions. More determined and concrete efforts to complete the banking union and the capital 
markets union would help mobilise the massive private investment necessary to achieve this, as the 
Governing Council stressed in its statement of 7 March 2024.
