Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have been broadly stable since our March meeting and wider financing 
conditions remain restrictive. The average interest rate on business loans edged down to 5.1 per cent 
in February, from 5.2 per cent in January. Mortgage rates were 3.8 per cent in February, down from 
3.9 per cent in January. 
Still elevated borrowing rates and associated cutbacks in investment plans led firms to further reduce 
their demand for loans in the first quarter of 2024, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. Credit 
standards for loans remained tight, with a further slight tightening for lending to firms and a moderate 
easing for mortgages. 
Against this background, credit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms grew marginally faster in 
February, at an annual rate of 0.4 per cent, up from 0.2 per cent in January. Growth in loans to 
households remained unchanged in February, at 0.3 per cent on an annual basis. Broad money – as 
measured by M3 – grew at a subdued rate of 0.4 per cent in February.
