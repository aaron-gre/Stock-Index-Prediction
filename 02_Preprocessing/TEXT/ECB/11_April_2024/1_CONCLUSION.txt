Conclusion
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. We are 
determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. 
We consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that are making a substantial contribution to 
the ongoing disinflation process. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will stay 
sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary. If our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further 
increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be 
appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. In any event, we will continue to 
follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and 
duration of restriction, and we are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
