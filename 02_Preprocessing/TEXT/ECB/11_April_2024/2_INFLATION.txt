Inflation
Inflation has continued to decline, from an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in February to 2.4 per cent in 
March, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate. Food price inflation dropped to 2.7 per cent in March, 
from 3.9 per cent in February, while energy price inflation stood at -1.8 per cent in March, after -3.7 
per cent in the previous month. Goods price inflation fell again in March, to 1.1 per cent, from 1.6 per 
cent in February. However, services price inflation remained high in March, at 4.0 per cent. 
Most measures of underlying inflation fell further in February, confirming the picture of gradually 
diminishing price pressures. While domestic inflation remains high, wages and unit profits grew less 
strongly than anticipated in the last quarter of 2023, but unit labour costs remained high, in part 
reflecting weak productivity growth. More recent indicators point to further moderation in wage growth.  
Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels in the coming months and to then decline to our 
target next year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the unfolding effects of our restrictive 
monetary policy, and the fading impact of the energy crisis and the pandemic. Measures of longer-
term inflation expectations remain broadly stable, with most standing around 2 per cent.
