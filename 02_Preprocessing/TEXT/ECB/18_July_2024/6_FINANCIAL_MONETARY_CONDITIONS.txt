Financial and monetary conditions
The policy rate cut in June has been transmitted smoothly to money market interest rates, while 
broader financial conditions have been somewhat volatile. Financing costs remain restrictive as our 
previous policy rate increases continue to work their way through the transmission chain. The average 
interest rate on new loans to firms edged down to 5.1 per cent in May, while mortgage rates remained 
unchanged at 3.8 per cent.  
Credit standards for loans remain tight. According to our latest bank lending survey, standards for 
lending to firms tightened slightly in the second quarter, while standards for mortgages eased 
moderately. Firms’ demand for loans fell slightly, while households’ demand for mortgages rose for the 
first time since early 2022.  
 
Overall, credit dynamics remain weak. Bank lending to firms and households grew at an annual rate of 
0.3 per cent in May, only marginally up from the previous month. The annual growth in broad money – 
as measured by M3 – rose to 1.6 per cent in May, from 1.3 per cent in April.
