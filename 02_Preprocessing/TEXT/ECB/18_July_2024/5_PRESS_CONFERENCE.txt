Press conference
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB 
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. 
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. The 
incoming information broadly supports our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. 
While some measures of underlying inflation ticked up in May owing to one-off factors, most measures 
were either stable or edged down in June. In line with expectations, the inflationary impact of high 
wage growth has been buffered by profits. Monetary policy is keeping financing conditions restrictive. 
At the same time, domestic price pressures are still high, services inflation is elevated and headline 
inflation is likely to remain above our target well into next year. 
We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely 
manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.  
We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the 
appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on 
our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-
committing to a particular rate path.  
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.  
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain 
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
