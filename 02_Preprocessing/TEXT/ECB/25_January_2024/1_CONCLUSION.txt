Conclusion
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. We are 
determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. 
Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, 
maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. Our future 
decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as 
necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level 
and duration of restriction. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
