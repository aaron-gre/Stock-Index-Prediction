Press conference
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB 
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. 
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged.  The 
incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium- term inflation 
outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in 
underlying inflation has continued, and our past interest rate increases keep being transmitted 
forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is 
helping to push down inflation. 
We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely 
manner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels 
that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. Our 
future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long 
as necessary. 
We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and 
duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the 
inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying 
inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. 
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.  
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain 
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.
