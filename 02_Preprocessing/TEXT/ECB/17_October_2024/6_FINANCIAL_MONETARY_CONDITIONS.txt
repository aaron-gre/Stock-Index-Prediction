Financial and monetary conditions
Shorter-term market interest rates have declined since our September meeting, owing mainly to 
weaker news on the euro area economy and the further fall in inflation. While financing conditions 
remain restrictive, the average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages were down 
slightly in August, to 5.0 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.  
 
Credit standards for business loans were unchanged in the third quarter, as reported in our latest bank 
lending survey, after more than two years of progressive tightening. Moreover, demand for loans by 
firms rose for the first time in two years. Overall lending to firms continues to be subdued, growing at 
an annual rate of 0.8 per cent in August. 
Credit standards for mortgages eased for the third quarter in a row, owing especially to greater 
competition among banks. Lower interest rates and better housing market prospects led to a strong 
increase in the demand for mortgages. In line with this, mortgage lending picked up slightly, growing at 
an annual rate of 0.6 per cent.
