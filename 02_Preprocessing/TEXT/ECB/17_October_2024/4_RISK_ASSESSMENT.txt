Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Lower confidence could prevent 
consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This could be amplified by sources 
of geopolitical risk, such as Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the 
Middle East, which could also disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Lower demand for euro area 
exports due, for instance, to a weaker world economy or an escalation in trade tensions between 
major economies would further weigh on euro area growth. Growth could also be lower if the lagged 
effects of monetary policy tightening turn out stronger than expected. Growth could be higher if the 
world economy grows more strongly than expected or if easier financing conditions  and declining 
inflation lead to a faster rebound in consumption and investment. 
Inflation could turn out higher than anticipated if wages or profits increase by more than expected. 
Upside risks to inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy 
prices and freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather 
events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices. By contrast, inflation 
may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical events prevent 
consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, monetary policy dampens demand 
more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world worsens unexpectedly.
