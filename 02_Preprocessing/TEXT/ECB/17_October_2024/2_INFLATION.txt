Inflation
Annual inflation fell further to 1.7 per cent in September, its lowest level since April 2021. Energy 
prices dropped sharply, at an annual rate of -6.1 per cent. Food price inflation went up slightly, to 2.4 
per cent. Goods inflation remained subdued, at 0.4 per cent, while services inflation edged down to 
3.9 per cent.   
 
Most measures of underlying inflation either declined or were unchanged. Domestic inflation is still 
elevated, as wage pressures in the euro area remain strong. Negotiated wage growth will remain high 
and volatile for the rest of the year, given the significant role of one-off payments and the staggered 
nature of wage adjustments.  
Inflation is expected to rise in the coming months, partly because previous sharp falls in energy prices 
will drop out of the annual rates. Inflation should then decline to target in the course of next year. The 
disinflation process should be supported by easing labour cost pressures and the past monetary policy 
tightening gradually feeding through to consumer prices. Most measures of longer -term inflation 
expectations stand at around 2 per cent.
