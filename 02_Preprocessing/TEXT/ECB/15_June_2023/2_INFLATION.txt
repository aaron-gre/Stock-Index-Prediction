Inflation
Inflation fell further to 6.1 per cent in May, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, from 7.0 per cent in 
April. The decline was broad-based. Energy price inflation, which had risen in April, resumed its 
downward trend and was negative in May. Food price inflation fell again but remained high at 12.5 per 
cent. 
Inflation excluding energy and food declined in May for the second month in a row, to 5.3 per cent 
from 5.6 per cent in April. Goods inflation decreased further, to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent in April. 
Services inflation fell for the first time in several months, from 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Indicators of 
underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening.  
 
Past increases in energy costs are still pushing up prices across the economy. Pent-up demand from 
the reopening of the economy also continues to drive up inflation, especially in services. Wage 
pressures, while partly reflecting one-off payments, are becoming an increasingly important source of 
inflation. Compensation per employee rose by 5.2 per cent in the first quarter of the year and 
negotiated wages by 4.3 per cent. Moreover, firms in some sectors have been able to keep profits 
relatively high, especially where demand has outstripped supply. Although most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2 per cent, some indicators remain elevated and 
need to be monitored closely.
