Risk assessment
The outlook for economic growth and inflation remains highly uncertain. Downside risks to growth 
include Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and an increase in broader geopolitical tensions, 
which could fragment global trade and thus weigh on the euro area economy. Growth could also be 
slower if the effects of monetary policy are more forceful than projected. Renewed financial market 
tensions could lead to even tighter financing conditions than anticipated and weaken confidence. Also, 
weaker growth in the world economy could further dampen economic activity in the euro area. 
However, growth could be higher than projected if the strong labour market and receding uncertainty 
mean that people and businesses become more confident and spend more.  
Upside risks to inflation include potential renewed upward pressures on the costs of energy and food, 
also related to Russia’s war against Ukraine. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, 
or higher than anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, 
including over the medium term. Recent wage agreements in a number of countries have added to the 
upside risks to inflation. By contrast, renewed financial market tensions could bring inflation down 
faster than projected. Weaker demand, for example due to a stronger transmission of monetary policy, 
would also lead to lower price pressures, especially over the medium term. Moreover, inflation would 
come down faster if declining energy prices and lower food price increases were to pass through to 
other goods and services more quickly than currently anticipated.
