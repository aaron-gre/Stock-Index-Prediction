Conclusion
Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. The Governing 
Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, in view of  
our determination to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely 
manner.  
Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently 
restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept 
at those levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to 
determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions 
will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic 
and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission.  
 
We are now ready to take your questions.
