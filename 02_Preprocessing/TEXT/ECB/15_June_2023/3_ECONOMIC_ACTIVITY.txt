Economic activity
The euro area economy has stagnated in recent months. As in the fourth quarter of last year, it shrank 
by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, amid a drop in private and public consumption. Economic 
growth is likely to remain weak in the short run but strengthen in the course of the year, as inflation 
comes down and supply disruptions continue to ease. Conditions in different sectors of the economy 
are uneven: manufacturing continues to weaken, partly owing to lower global demand and tighter euro 
area financing conditions, while services remain resilient.  
The labour market remains a source of strength. Almost a million new jobs were added in the first 
quarter of the year and the unemployment rate stood at its historical low of 6.5 per cent in April. The 
average number of hours worked has also increased, although it is still somewhat below its pre-
pandemic level. 
As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and 
in a concerted manner to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would call for a 
stronger monetary policy response. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more 
productive and gradually bring down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply 
capacity, especially in the energy sector, can also help reduce price pressures in the medium term. 
The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be concluded soon.
