Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates in the euro area decreased after our January meeting but have risen over recent
days in response to a revised outlook for fiscal policy. Our interest rate cuts are gradually making it
less expensive for firms and households to borrow and loan growth is picking up. At the same time, a
headwind to the easing of financing conditions comes from past interest rate hikes still transmitting to
the stock of credit, and lending remains subdued overall.
The average interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.2 per cent in January, from 4.4 per cent
in December. By contrast, firmsâ€™ cost of issuing market-based debt rose to 3.7 per cent, 0.2
percentage points above its December level. Over the same period, the average interest rate on new
mortgages declined to 3.3 per cent, from 3.4 per cent.
Growth in bank lending to firms rose to 2.0 per cent in January, up from 1.7 per cent in December, on
the back of a moderate monthly flow of new loans. Growth in debt securities issued by firms rose to
3.4 per cent in annual terms. Mortgage lending continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall,
with an annual growth rate of 1.3 per cent.
