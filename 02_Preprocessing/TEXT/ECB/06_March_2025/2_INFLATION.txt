Inflation
Annual inflation stood at 2.4 per cent in February, after 2.5 per cent in January and 2.4 per cent in
December, according to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate. Energy price inflation slowed to 0.2 per cent,
following a strong increase to 1.9 per cent in January, from 0.1 per cent in December. By contrast,
food price inflation rose to 2.7 per cent, from 2.3 per cent in January and 2.6 per cent in December.
Goods inflation ticked up to 0.6 per cent, while services inflation eased to 3.7 per cent, from 3.9 per
cent in January and 4.0 per cent in December.
Most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to our two per cent
medium-term target. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, declined in January.
But it remains high, as wages and some services prices are still adjusting to the past inflation surge
with a substantial delay. At the same time, recent wage negotiations point to a continued moderation in
labour cost pressures.
The assumption of higher energy price inflation led staff to revise up the headline inflation projection
for 2025. At the same time, staff expect core inflation to continue slowing, as labour cost pressures
ease further and the past monetary policy tightening continues to weigh on prices. Most measures of
