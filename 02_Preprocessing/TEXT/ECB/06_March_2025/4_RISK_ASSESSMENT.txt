Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. An escalation in trade tensions would
lower euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Ongoing
uncertainty about global trade policies could drag investment down. Geopolitical tensions, such as
Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remain a major
source of uncertainty as well. Growth could be lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening
last longer than expected. At the same time, growth could be higher if easier financing conditions and
falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound faster. An increase in defence
and infrastructure spending could also add to growth.
Increasing friction in global trade is adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. A
general escalation in trade tensions could see the euro depreciate and import costs rise, which would
put upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, lower demand for euro area exports as a result of
higher tariffs and a re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity would put
downward pressure on inflation. Geopolitical tensions create two-sided inflation risks as regards
energy markets, consumer confidence and business investment. Extreme weather events, and the
unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. Inflation could
turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. A boost in defence and
infrastructure spending could also raise inflation through its effect on aggregate demand. But inflation
might surprise on the downside if monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected.
