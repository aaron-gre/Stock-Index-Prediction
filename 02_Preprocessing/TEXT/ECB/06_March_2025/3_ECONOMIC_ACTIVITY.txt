Economic activity
The euro area economy likely grew modestly in the fourth quarter of 2024. The first two months of
2025 saw a continuation of many of last year’s patterns. Manufacturing is still a drag on growth even if
survey indicators are improving. High uncertainty, both at home and abroad, is holding back
investment and competitiveness challenges are weighing on exports. At the same time, services are
resilient. Moreover, rising household incomes and the robust labour market are supporting a gradual
pick-up in consumption, although consumer confidence is still fragile and saving rates are high.
The unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.2 per cent in January, and employment is
estimated to have grown by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2024. However, demand for labour has
moderated, and recent survey data suggest that employment growth was subdued in the first two
months of 2025.
Uncertainty has increased and is likely to weigh on investment and exports by more than previously
expected. But growth should be supported by higher incomes and lower borrowing costs. According to
the staff projections, exports should also be supported by rising global demand so long as trade
tensions do not escalate further.
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient.
The European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action and
its proposals should be swiftly adopted. Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line
with the EU’s economic governance framework and prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural
reforms and strategic investment.
