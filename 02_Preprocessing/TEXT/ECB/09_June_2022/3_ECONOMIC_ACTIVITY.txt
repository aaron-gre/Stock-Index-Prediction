Economic activity
In the near term, we expect activity to be dampened by high energy costs, the deterioration in the 
terms of trade, greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income. The  
 
war in Ukraine and renewed pandemic restrictions in China have made supply bottlenecks worse 
again. As a result, firms face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains, and their outlook for 
future output has deteriorated.  
However, there are also factors supporting economic activity and these are expected to strengthen 
over the months to come. The reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong 
labour market, with more people in jobs, will continue to support incomes and consumption. In 
addition, savings accumulated during the pandemic are a buffer.  
Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war. Targeted and temporary budgetary measures 
protect those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding to 
inflationary pressures. The swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under 
the Next Generation EU programme, the “Fit for 55” package and the REPowerEU plan would also 
help the euro area economy to grow faster in a sustainable manner and become more resilient to 
global shocks.
