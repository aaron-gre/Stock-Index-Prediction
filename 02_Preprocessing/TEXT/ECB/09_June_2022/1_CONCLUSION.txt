Conclusion
Summing up, Russiaâ€™s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is severely affecting the euro area 
economy and the outlook is still surrounded by high uncertainty. But the conditions are in place for the 
economy to continue to grow and to recover further over the medium term.  
Inflation is undesirably high and is expected to remain above our target for some time. We will make 
sure that inflation returns to our two per cent target over the medium term. Accordingly, we decided to 
take further steps in normalising our monetary policy. The calibration of our policies will remain data-
dependent and reflect our evolving assessment of the outlook. We stand ready to adjust all of our 
instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises 
at our two per cent target over the medium term.  
We are now ready to take your questions.
