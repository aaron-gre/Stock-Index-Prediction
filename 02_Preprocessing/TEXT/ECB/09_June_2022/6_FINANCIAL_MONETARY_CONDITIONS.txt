Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have increased in response to the changing outlook for inflation and monetary 
policy. With benchmark interest rates rising, bank funding costs have increased, and this has fed into 
higher bank lending rates in particular for households. Nevertheless, lending to firms picked up in 
March. This was because of the continued need to finance investment and working capital, against the 
backdrop of increasing production costs, persisting supply bottlenecks and lower reliance on market 
funding. Lending to households also increased, reflecting continued robust demand for mortgages.  
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council has undertaken its bi annual in-depth 
assessment of the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. The environment for 
financial stability has worsened since our last review in December 2021, especially over the short 
term. In particular, lower growth and increasing cost pressures, as well as rising risk-free rates and 
sovereign bond yields, could lead to a further deterioration in the financing conditions faced by 
borrowers. At the same time, tighter financing conditions could reduce some existing financial stability 
vulnerabilities over the medium term. Banks, which started the year with solid capital positions and 
improving asset quality, are now facing greater credit risk. We will watch these factors closely. In any 
case, macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and 
addressing medium-term vulnerabilities.
