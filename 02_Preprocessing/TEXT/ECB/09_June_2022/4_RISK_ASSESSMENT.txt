Risk assessment
Risks relating to the pandemic have declined but the war continues to be a significant downside risk to 
growth. In particular, a major risk would be a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area, 
as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections. Furthermore, if the war were to 
escalate, economic sentiment could worsen, supply-side constraints could increase, and energy and 
food costs could remain persistently higher than expected.  
The risks surrounding inflation are primarily on the upside. The risks to the medium-term inflation 
outlook include a durable worsening of the production capacity of our economy, persistently high 
energy and food prices, inflation expectations rising above our target and higher than anticipated wage 
rises. However, if demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures  on prices.
