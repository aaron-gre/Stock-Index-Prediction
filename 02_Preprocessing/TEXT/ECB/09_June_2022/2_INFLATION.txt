Inflation
Inflation rose further to 8.1 per cent in May. Although governments have intervened and have helped 
slow energy inflation, energy prices stand 39.2 per cent above their levels one year ago. Market-based 
indicators suggest that global energy prices will stay high in the near term but will then moderate to 
some extent. Food prices rose 7.5 per cent in May, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine and 
Russia among the main global producers of agricultural goods.  
Prices have also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and because of 
recovering domestic demand, especially in the services sector, as our economy reopens. Price rises 
are becoming more widespread across sectors. Accordingly, measures of underlying inflation have 
been rising further.  
The labour market continues to improve, with unemployment remaining at its historical low of 6.8 per 
cent in April. Job vacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour. Wage 
growth, including in forward-looking indicators, has started to pick up. Over time, the strengthening of 
the economy and some catch-up effects should support faster growth in wages. While most measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys stand at 
around two per cent, initial signs of above-target revisions in those measures warrant close 
monitoring.
