Combined monetary policy decisions and 
statement 
12 December 2024  
Monetary policy decisions 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council 
steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.  
The disinflation process is well on track. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.4 % in 2024, 2.1% in 
2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.1% in 2027 when the expanded EU Emissions Trading System becomes 
operational. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an average of 2.9% in 2024, 2.3% in 
2025 and 1.9% in both 2026 and 2027. 
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing 
Council’s 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but 
remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past 
inflation surge with a substantial delay. 
Financing conditions are easing, as the Governing Council’s recent interest rate cuts gradually make 
new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. But they continue to be tight because 
monetary policy remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outs tanding 
stock of credit.  
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections . Although growth 
picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current 
quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7% in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, 1.4% in 2026 and 1.3% in 
2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which should allow households to 
consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually fading effects of restrictive 
monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.   
 
The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-
term target. It will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the 
appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will 
be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial 
data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The 
Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. 
Key ECB interest rates 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. 
Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal 
lending facility will be decreased to 3.00%, 3.15% and 3.40% respectively, with effect from 18 
December 2024. 
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) 
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer 
reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. 
The Eurosystem no longer reinvests all of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased 
under the PEPP, reducing the PEPP portfolio by €7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing 
Council will discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024. 
 
Refinancing operations 
Banks will repay the remaining amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing 
operations this month, which concludes this part of the balance sheet normalisation process.  
*** 
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that 
inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth 
functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is 
available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the  
 
transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to 
more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. 
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press 
conference starting at 14:45 CET today. 
   
 
Monetary policy statement 
Press conference 
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB 
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.  
The disinflation process is well on track. Staff see headline inflation averaging 2.4 per cent in 2024, 
2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 2.1 per cent in 2027 when the expanded EU Emissions 
Trading System becomes operational. For inflation excluding energy and food, staff project an 
average of 2.9 per cent in 2024, 2.3 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 per cent in both 2026 and 2027. 
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent 
medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but remains high, mostly 
because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a 
substantial delay. 
Financing conditions are easing, as our recent interest rate cuts gradually make new borrowing less 
expensive for firms and households. But they continue to be tight because our monetary policy 
remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the outstanding stock of credit.  
Staff now expect a slower economic recovery than in the September projections. Although growth 
picked up in the third quarter of this year, survey indicators suggest it has slowed in the current 
quarter. Staff see the economy growing by 0.7 per cent in 2024, 1.1 per cent in 2025, 1.4 per cent in 
2026 and 1.3 per cent in 2027. The projected recovery rests mainly on rising real incomes – which 
should allow households to consume more – and firms increasing investment. Over time, the gradually 
fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in domestic demand.  
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term 
target. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the 
appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our 
assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics  
 
of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to 
a particular rate path. 
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.  
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain 
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. 
Economic activity 
The economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. Growth was driven 
mainly by an increase in consumption, partly reflecting one-off factors that boosted tourism over the 
summer, and by firms building up inventories. But the latest information suggests it is losing 
momentum. Surveys indicate that manufacturing is still contracting and growth in services is slowing. 
Firms are holding back their investment spending in the face of weak demand and a highly uncertain 
outlook. Exports are also weak, with some European industries finding it challenging to remain 
competitive. 
The labour market remains resilient. Employment grew by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, again by 
more than expected. The unemployment rate remained at its historical low of 6.3 per cent in October. 
Meanwhile, demand for labour continues to weaken. The job vacancy rate declined to 2.5% in the third 
quarter, 0.8 percentage points below its peak, and surveys also point to fewer jobs being created in 
the current quarter. 
The economy should strengthen over time, although more slowly than previously expected. The rise in 
real wages should strengthen household spending. More affordable credit should boost consumption 
and investment. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should support the recovery as 
global demand rises. 
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. It is 
crucial to swiftly follow up, with concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario Draghi ’s proposals 
for enhancing European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s proposals for empowering the Single 
Market. We welcome the European Commission’s assessment of governments’ medium-term plans 
for fiscal and structural policies, as part of the EU’s revised economic governance framework. 
Governments should now focus on implementing their commitments under this framework fully and 
without delay. This will help bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a sustained basis, while 
prioritising growth-enhancing reforms and investment.  
 
Inflation 
Annual inflation increased to 2.3 per cent in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 2.0 
per cent in October. The increase was expected and primarily reflected an energy-related upward 
base effect. Food price inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent and services inflation to 3.9 per cent. 
Goods inflation went up to 0.7 per cent. 
Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at 
4.2%, it remains high. This reflects strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices are 
still adjusting with a delay to the past inflation surge. That said, underlying inflation is overall 
developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target. 
The increase in compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 
per cent in the second. Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs. 
Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage 
growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects 
of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term. 
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in 
energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the 
two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past 
monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to 
longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s 
October meeting. 
Risk assessment  
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade 
could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower 
confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This 
could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be 
lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if 
easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound 
faster. 
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to 
inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and  
 
freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and 
the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By 
contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical 
events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy 
dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world 
worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more 
uncertain. 
Financial and monetary conditions 
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the 
perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our 
interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow.  
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a 
percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by 
more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in 
October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the 
average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise. 
Bank lending to firms has gradually picked up from low levels, and increased by 1.2 per cent in 
October compared with a year earlier. Debt securities issued by firms were up 3.1% in annual terms, 
which was similar to the increase in the previous few months. Mortgage lending continued to rise 
gradually in October, with an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient and there are few 
signs of financial market stress. Financial stability risks nonetheless remain elevated. Macroprudential 
policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing 
resilience and preserving macroprudential space. 
Conclusion  
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensure  
 
that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. We will follow a data-
dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. 
In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light 
of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of 
monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary 
policy transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
