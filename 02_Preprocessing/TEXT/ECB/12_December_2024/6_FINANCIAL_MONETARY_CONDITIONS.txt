Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates in the euro area have declined further since our October meeting, reflecting the 
perceived worsening of the economic outlook. Although financing conditions remain restrictive, our 
interest rate cuts are gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow.  
The average interest rate on new loans to firms was 4.7 per cent in October, more than half a 
percentage point below its peak a year earlier. The cost of issuing market-based debt has fallen by 
more than a percentage point since its peak. The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.6 per cent in 
October, is about half a percentage point lower than at its highest point in 2023, even though the 
average rate on the outstanding stock of mortgages is still set to rise. 
Bank lending to firms has gradually picked up from low levels, and increased by 1.2 per cent in 
October compared with a year earlier. Debt securities issued by firms were up 3.1% in annual terms, 
which was similar to the increase in the previous few months. Mortgage lending continued to rise 
gradually in October, with an annual growth rate of 0.8 per cent. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks remain resilient and there are few 
signs of financial market stress. Financial stability risks nonetheless remain elevated. Macroprudential 
policy remains the first line of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, enhancing 
resilience and preserving macroprudential space.
