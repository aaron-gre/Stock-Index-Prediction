Inflation
Annual inflation increased to 2.3 per cent in November according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, from 2.0 
per cent in October. The increase was expected and primarily reflected an energy-related upward 
base effect. Food price inflation edged down to 2.8 per cent and services inflation to 3.9 per cent. 
Goods inflation went up to 0.7 per cent. 
Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, again eased somewhat in October. But at 
4.2%, it remains high. This reflects strong wage pressures and the fact that some services prices are 
still adjusting with a delay to the past inflation surge. That said, underlying inflation is overall 
developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to target. 
The increase in compensation per employee moderated to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from 4.7 
per cent in the second. Amid stable productivity, this contributed to slower growth in unit labour costs. 
Staff expect labour costs to increase more slowly over the projection horizon as a result of lower wage 
growth and higher productivity growth. Moreover, profits should continue to partially offset the effects 
of higher labour costs on prices, especially in the near term. 
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, as previous sharp falls in 
energy prices continue to drop out of the annual rates. It should then settle sustainably at around the 
two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the continuing impact of our past 
monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. Most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and market-based indicators of medium to 
longer-term inflation compensation have decreased measurably since the Governing Council’s 
October meeting.
