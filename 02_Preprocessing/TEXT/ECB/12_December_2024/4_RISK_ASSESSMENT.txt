Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. The risk of greater friction in global trade 
could weigh on euro area growth by dampening exports and weakening the global economy. Lower 
confidence could prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected. This 
could be amplified by geopolitical risks, such as Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, which could disrupt energy supplies and global trade. Growth could also be 
lower if the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening last longer than expected. It could be higher if 
easier financing conditions and falling inflation allow domestic consumption and investment to rebound 
faster. 
Inflation could turn out higher if wages or profits increase by more than expected. Upside risks to 
inflation also stem from the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could push energy prices and  
 
freight costs higher in the near term and disrupt global trade. Moreover, extreme weather events, and 
the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected. By 
contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if low confidence and concerns about geopolitical 
events prevent consumption and investment from recovering as fast as expected, if monetary policy 
dampens demand more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world 
worsens unexpectedly. Greater friction in global trade would make the euro area inflation outlook more 
uncertain.
