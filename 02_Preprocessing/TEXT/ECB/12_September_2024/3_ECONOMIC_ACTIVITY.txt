Economic activity
The economy grew by 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, after 0.3 per cent in the first quarter, falling 
short of the latest staff projections. Growth stemmed mainly from net exports and government 
spending. Private domestic demand weakened, as households consumed less, firms cut down 
business investment and housing investment dropped. While services supported growth, industry and 
construction contributed negatively. According to survey indicators, the recovery is continuing to face 
some headwinds.  
We expect the recovery to strengthen over time, as rising real incomes allow households to consume 
more. The gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support consumption and 
investment. Exports should also continue contributing to the recovery as global demand rises. 
The labour market remains resilient. The unemployment rate was broadly unchanged in July, at 6.4 
per cent. At the same time, employment growth slowed to 0.2 per cent in the second quarter, from 0.3 
per cent in the first. Recent survey indicators point to a further moderation in demand for labour, and 
the job vacancy rate has fallen closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
Fiscal and structural policies should be aimed at making the economy more productive and 
competitive, which would help to raise potential growth and reduce price pressures in the medium 
term. Mario Draghi's report on the future of European competitiveness and Enrico Letta’s report on 
empowering the Single Market stress the urgent need for reform and provide concrete proposals to 
make this happen. Implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework fully , 
transparently and without delay will help governments bring down budget deficits and debt ratios on a 
sustained basis. Governments should now make a strong start in this direction in their medium-term 
plans for fiscal and structural policies.
