Inflation
According to Eurostatâ€™s flash estimate, annual inflation dropped to 2.2 per cent in August, from 2.6 per 
cent in July. Energy prices fell at an annual rate of 3.0 per cent, after an increase of 1.2 per cent in the 
previous month. Food price inflation went up slightly, to 2.4 per cent in August. Goods inflation and 
services inflation moved in opposite directions. Goods inflation declined to 0.4 per cent, from 0.7 per 
cent in July, while services inflation rose, to 4.2 per cent from 4.0 per cent.  
Most measures of underlying inflation were broadly unchanged in July. Domestic inflation edged down 
only slightly, to 4.4 per cent from 4.5 per cent in June, with strong price pressures coming especially 
from wages. Negotiated wage growth will remain high and volatile over the remainder of the year, 
given the significant role of one-off payments in some countries and the staggered nature of wage 
adjustments. At the same time, the overall growth in labour costs is moderating. The growth in 
compensation per employee fell further to 4.3 per cent in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive 
decline, and ECB staff project it to slow markedly again next year. Despite weak productivity, unit 
labour costs grew less strongly in the second quarter, by 4.6 per cent, after 5.2 per cent in the first 
quarter. Staff expect unit labour cost growth to continue declining over the projection horizon owing to 
lower wage growth and a recovery in productivity. Finally, profits are continuing to partially offset the 
inflationary effects of higher labour costs.  
The disinflation process should be supported by receding labour cost pressures and the past 
monetary policy tightening gradually feeding through to consumer prices. Most measures of longer-
term inflation expectations stand at around 2 per cent, and the market-based measures have fallen 
closer to that level since our July meeting.
