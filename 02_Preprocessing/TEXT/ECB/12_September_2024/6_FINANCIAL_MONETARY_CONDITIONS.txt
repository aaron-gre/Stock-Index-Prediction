Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have declined markedly since our July meeting, mostly owing to a weaker 
outlook for global growth and reduced concerns about inflation pressures. Tensions in global markets 
over the summer led to a temporary tightening of financial conditions in the riskier market segments.  
Overall, financing costs remain restrictive as our past policy rate increases continue to work their way 
through the transmission chain. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new 
mortgages stayed high in July, at 5.1 and 3.8 per cent respectively. 
Credit growth remains sluggish amid weak demand. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 
0.6 per cent in July, down slightly from June, and growth in loans to households edged up to 0.5 per 
cent. Broad money – as measured by M3 – grew by 2.3 per cent in July, the same rate as in June.
