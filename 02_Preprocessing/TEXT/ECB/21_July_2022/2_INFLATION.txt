Inflation
Inflation increased further to 8.6 per cent in June. Surging energy prices were again the most 
important component of overall inflation. Market-based indicators suggest that global energy prices will 
stay high in the near term. Food inflation also rose further, standing at 8.9 per cent in June, in part 
reflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia as producers of agricultural goods.   
 
Persistent supply bottlenecks for industrial goods and recovering demand, especially in the services 
sector, are also contributing to the current high rates of inflation. Price pressures are spreading across 
more and more sectors, in part owing to the indirect impact of high energy costs across the whole 
economy. Accordingly, most measures of underlying inflation have risen further. 
We expect inflation to remain undesirably high for some time, owing to continued pressures from 
energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain. Higher inflationary pressures are 
also stemming from the depreciation of the euro exchange rate. But looking further ahead, in the 
absence of new disruptions, energy costs should stabilise and supply bottlenecks should ease, which, 
together with the ongoing policy normalisation, should support the return of inflation to our target.  
The labour market remains strong. Unemployment fell to a historical low of 6.6 per cent in May. Job 
vacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour. Wage growth, also 
according to forward-looking indicators, has continued to increase gradually over the last few months, 
but still remains contained overall. Over time, the strengthening of the economy and some catch-up 
effects should support faster growth in wages. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations 
currently stand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators 
warrant continued monitoring.
