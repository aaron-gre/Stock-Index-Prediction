Economic activity
Economic activity is slowing. Russiaâ€™s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is an ongoing drag on 
growth. The impact of high inflation on purchasing power, continuous supply constraints and higher 
uncertainty are having a dampening effect on the economy. Firms continue to face higher costs and 
disruptions in their supply chains, although there are tentative signs that some of the supply 
bottlenecks are easing. Taken together, these factors are significantly clouding the outlook for the 
second half of 2022 and beyond. 
At the same time, economic activity continues to benefit from the reopening of the economy, a strong 
labour market and fiscal policy support. In particular, the full reopening of the economy is supporting 
spending in the services sector. As people start to travel again, tourism is expected to help the 
economy in the third quarter of this year. Consumption is being supported by the savings that 
households built up during the pandemic and by a strong labour market.  
Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war in Ukraine for those bearing the brunt of higher 
energy prices. Temporary and targeted measures should be tailored so as to limit the risk of fuelling 
inflationary pressures. Fiscal policies in all countries should aim at preserving debt sustainability, as 
well as raising the growth potential in a sustainable manner to enhance the recovery .
