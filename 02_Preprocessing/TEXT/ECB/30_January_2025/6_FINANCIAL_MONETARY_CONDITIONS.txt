Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates in the euro area have risen since our December meeting, partly mirroring higher 
rates in global financial markets. While financing conditions remain tight, our interest rate cuts are 
gradually making it less expensive for firms and households to borrow.  
The average interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.5 per cent in November , while the cost of 
issuing market-based debt remained at 3.6 per cent. The average rate on new mortgages edged down 
to 3.5 per cent.   
 
Growth in bank lending to firms rose to 1.5 per cent in December, up from 1.0 per cent in November, 
amid a strong monthly flow. Growth in debt securities issued by firms moderated to 3.2 per cent in 
annual terms. Mortgage lending continued to rise gradually but remained muted overall, with an 
annual growth rate of 1.1 per cent. 
Credit standards for business loans tightened again in the fourth quarter of 2024, having broadly 
stabilised over the previous four quarters, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. The renewed 
tightening mainly reflected banks becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their customers 
and less willing to take on risks themselves. Demand for loans by firms increased slightly in the fourth 
quarter but remained weak overall. Credit standards for mortgages were broadly unchanged, after 
three quarters of easing, while the demand for mortgages again increased strongly, mainly because of 
more attractive interest rates.
