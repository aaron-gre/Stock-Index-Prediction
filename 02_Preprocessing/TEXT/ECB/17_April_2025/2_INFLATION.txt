Inflation
Annual inflation edged down to 2.2 per cent in March. Energy prices fell by 1.0 per cent, after a slight 
rise in February, while food price inflation rose to 2.9 per cent in March, from 2.7 per cent in February. 
Goods inflation was stable at 0.6 per cent. Services inflation fell again in March, to 3.5 per cent, and it 
now stands half a percentage point below the rate recorded at the end of last year.  
Most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to our two per cent 
medium-term target. Domestic inflation has declined since the end of 2024. Wages are gradually 
moderating. In the last quarter of 2024 annual growth in compensation per employee stood at 4.1 per 
cent, down from 4.5 per cent in the previous quarter. Rising productivity also meant that unit labour 
costs grew more slowly. The ECBâ€™s wage tracker and information from our contacts with companies  
 
point to a decline in wage growth in 2025, as also indicated in the March staff projections. Unit profits 
fell at an annual rate of 1.1 per cent at the end of last year, contributing to lower domestic inflation.  
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per cent, which 
supports the sustainable return of inflation to our target.
