Risk assessment
Downside risks to economic growth have increased. The major escalation in global trade tensions and 
associated uncertainties will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports, and it may drag 
down investment and consumption. Deteriorating financial market sentiment could lead to tighter 
financing conditions, increase risk aversion and make firms and households less willing to invest and 
consume. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, also remain a major source of uncertainty. At the same time, an increase in 
defence and infrastructure spending would add to growth. 
Increasing global trade disruptions are adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. 
Falling global energy prices and appreciation of the euro could put further downward pressure on 
inflation. This could be reinforced by lower demand for euro area exports owing to higher tariffs, and a 
re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity. Adverse financial market 
reactions to the trade tensions could weigh on domestic demand and thereby also lower inflation. By 
contrast, a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise inflation by pushing up import prices. A 
boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term.  Extreme 
weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than 
expected.
