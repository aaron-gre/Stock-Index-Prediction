Economic activity
The economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty. Euro area exporters face new barriers to 
trade, although their scope remains unclear. Disruptions to international commerce, financial market 
tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment. As consumers become 
more cautious about the future, they may hold back from spending as well.  
At the same time, the euro area economy has been building up some resilience against the global 
shocks. The economy is likely to have grown in the first quarter of the year, and manufacturing has 
shown signs of stabilisation. Unemployment fell to 6.1 per cent in February, its lowest level since the 
launch of the euro. A strong labour market, higher real incomes and the impact of our monetary policy 
should underpin spending. The important policy initiatives that have been launched at the national and 
EU levels to increase defence spending and infrastructure investment can be expected to bolster 
manufacturing, which is also reflected in recent surveys. 
In the present geopolitical environment, it is even more urgent for fiscal and structural policies to make 
the euro area economy more productive, competitive and resilient. The European Commission’s 
Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on 
simplification, should be swiftly adopted. This includes completing the savings and investment union, 
following a clear and ambitious timetable, which should help savers benefit from more opportunities to 
invest and improve firms’ access to finance, especially risk capital. It is also important to rapidly 
establish the legislative framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of a digital euro. 
Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance 
framework and prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment.
