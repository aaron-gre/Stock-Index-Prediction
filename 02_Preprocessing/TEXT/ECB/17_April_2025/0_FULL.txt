Combined monetary policy decisions and 
statement 
17 April 2025 
Monetary policy decisions 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council 
steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.  
The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop as staff expected, with both 
headline and core inflation declining in March. Services inflation has also eased markedly over recent 
months. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing 
Council’s 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth is moderating, and profits are 
partially buffering the impact of still elevated wage growth on inflation. The euro area economy has 
been building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated 
owing to rising trade tensions. Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households 
and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a 
tightening impact on financing conditions. These factors may further weigh on the economic outlook 
for the euro area.  
The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-
term target. Especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, it will follow a data-dependent 
and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In 
particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the 
inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying 
inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-
committing to a particular rate path. Key ECB interest rates 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. 
Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal 
lending facility will be decreased to 2.25%, 2.40% and 2.65% respectively, with effect from 23 April 
2025. 
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) 
The APP and PEPP portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem 
no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. 
*** 
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that 
inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth 
functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is 
available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the 
transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to 
more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. 
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press 
conference starting at 14:45 CET today.  
 
Monetary policy statement 
Press conference 
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB 
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. 
The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop as staff expected, with both 
headline and core inflation declining in March. Services inflation has also eased markedly over recent 
months. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per 
cent medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth is moderating, and profits are partially 
buffering the impact of still elevated wage growth on inflation. The euro area economy has been 
building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to 
rising trade tensions. Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and 
firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening 
impact on financing conditions. These factors may further weigh on the economic outlook for the euro 
area.  
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium- term 
target. Especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will follow a data-dependent and 
meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our 
interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming 
economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.  
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.  
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain 
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions.  
 
Economic activity 
The economic outlook is clouded by exceptional uncertainty. Euro area exporters face new barriers to 
trade, although their scope remains unclear. Disruptions to international commerce, financial market 
tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment. As consumers become 
more cautious about the future, they may hold back from spending as well.  
At the same time, the euro area economy has been building up some resilience against the global 
shocks. The economy is likely to have grown in the first quarter of the year, and manufacturing has 
shown signs of stabilisation. Unemployment fell to 6.1 per cent in February, its lowest level since the 
launch of the euro. A strong labour market, higher real incomes and the impact of our monetary policy 
should underpin spending. The important policy initiatives that have been launched at the national and 
EU levels to increase defence spending and infrastructure investment can be expected to bolster 
manufacturing, which is also reflected in recent surveys. 
In the present geopolitical environment, it is even more urgent for fiscal and structural policies to make 
the euro area economy more productive, competitive and resilient. The European Commission’s 
Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on 
simplification, should be swiftly adopted. This includes completing the savings and investment union, 
following a clear and ambitious timetable, which should help savers benefit from more opportunities to 
invest and improve firms’ access to finance, especially risk capital. It is also important to rapidly 
establish the legislative framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of a digital euro. 
Governments should ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance 
framework and prioritise essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. 
Inflation 
Annual inflation edged down to 2.2 per cent in March. Energy prices fell by 1.0 per cent, after a slight 
rise in February, while food price inflation rose to 2.9 per cent in March, from 2.7 per cent in February. 
Goods inflation was stable at 0.6 per cent. Services inflation fell again in March, to 3.5 per cent, and it 
now stands half a percentage point below the rate recorded at the end of last year.  
Most indicators of underlying inflation are pointing to a sustained return of inflation to our two per cent 
medium-term target. Domestic inflation has declined since the end of 2024. Wages are gradually 
moderating. In the last quarter of 2024 annual growth in compensation per employee stood at 4.1 per 
cent, down from 4.5 per cent in the previous quarter. Rising productivity also meant that unit labour 
costs grew more slowly. The ECB’s wage tracker and information from our contacts with companies  
 
point to a decline in wage growth in 2025, as also indicated in the March staff projections. Unit profits 
fell at an annual rate of 1.1 per cent at the end of last year, contributing to lower domestic inflation.  
Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per cent, which 
supports the sustainable return of inflation to our target. 
Risk assessment  
Downside risks to economic growth have increased. The major escalation in global trade tensions and 
associated uncertainties will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports, and it may drag 
down investment and consumption. Deteriorating financial market sentiment could lead to tighter 
financing conditions, increase risk aversion and make firms and households less willing to invest and 
consume. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, also remain a major source of uncertainty. At the same time, an increase in 
defence and infrastructure spending would add to growth. 
Increasing global trade disruptions are adding more uncertainty to the outlook for euro area inflation. 
Falling global energy prices and appreciation of the euro could put further downward pressure on 
inflation. This could be reinforced by lower demand for euro area exports owing to higher tariffs, and a 
re-routing of exports into the euro area from countries with overcapacity. Adverse financial market 
reactions to the trade tensions could weigh on domestic demand and thereby also lower inflation. By 
contrast, a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise inflation by pushing up import prices. A 
boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term.  Extreme 
weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than 
expected.  
Financial and monetary conditions 
Risk-free interest rates have declined in response to the escalating trade tensions. Equity prices have 
fallen amid high volatility and corporate bond spreads have widened around the globe. The euro has 
strengthened over recent weeks as investor sentiment has proven more resilient towards the euro 
area than towards other economies. 
The latest official statistics on corporate borrowing, which predated these market tensions, continued 
to indicate that our interest rate cuts had made it less expensive for firms to borrow. The average 
interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.1 per cent in February, from 4.3 per cent in January. 
Firms’ cost of issuing market-based debt declined to 3.5 per cent in February, but there has been  
 
some upward pressure more recently. Moreover, growth in lending to firms picked up again in 
February, to 2.2 per cent, while debt securities issuance by firms grew at an unchanged rate of 3.2 per 
cent.  
At the same time, credit standards for business loans tightened slightly again in the first quarter of 
2025, as reported in our latest bank lending survey for the euro area. As in the previous quarter, this 
was mainly because banks are becoming more concerned about the economic risks faced by their 
customers. Demand for loans to firms decreased slightly in the first quarter, after a modest recovery in 
previous quarters. 
The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.3 per cent in February, increased on the back of earlier rises 
in longer-term market rates. Mortgage lending continued to strengthen in February, albeit at a still 
subdued annual rate of 1.5 per cent, as banks eased their credit standards and demand for loans to 
households continued to increase strongly. 
Conclusion  
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensure 
that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. Especially in current 
conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting 
approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, our interest  rate 
decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic 
and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary 
policy transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
