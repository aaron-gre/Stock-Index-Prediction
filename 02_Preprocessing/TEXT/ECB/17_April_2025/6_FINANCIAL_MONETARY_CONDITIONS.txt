Financial and monetary conditions
Risk-free interest rates have declined in response to the escalating trade tensions. Equity prices have 
fallen amid high volatility and corporate bond spreads have widened around the globe. The euro has 
strengthened over recent weeks as investor sentiment has proven more resilient towards the euro 
area than towards other economies. 
The latest official statistics on corporate borrowing, which predated these market tensions, continued 
to indicate that our interest rate cuts had made it less expensive for firms to borrow. The average 
interest rate on new loans to firms declined to 4.1 per cent in February, from 4.3 per cent in January. 
Firmsâ€™ cost of issuing market-based debt declined to 3.5 per cent in February, but there has been  
 
some upward pressure more recently. Moreover, growth in lending to firms picked up again in 
February, to 2.2 per cent, while debt securities issuance by firms grew at an unchanged rate of 3.2 per 
cent.  
At the same time, credit standards for business loans tightened slightly again in the first quarter of 
2025, as reported in our latest bank lending survey for the euro area. As in the previous quarter, this 
was mainly because banks are becoming more concerned about the economic risks faced by their 
customers. Demand for loans to firms decreased slightly in the first quarter, after a modest recovery in 
previous quarters. 
The average rate on new mortgages, at 3.3 per cent in February, increased on the back of earlier rises 
in longer-term market rates. Mortgage lending continued to strengthen in February, albeit at a still 
subdued annual rate of 1.5 per cent, as banks eased their credit standards and demand for loans to 
households continued to increase strongly.
