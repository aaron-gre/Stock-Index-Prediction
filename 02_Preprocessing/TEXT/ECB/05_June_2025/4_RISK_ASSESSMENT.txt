Risk assessment
Risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation in global trade tensions 
and associated uncertainties could lower euro area growth by dampening exports  and dragging down 
investment and consumption. A deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter 
financing conditions and greater risk aversion, and make firms and households less willing to invest 
and consume. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty. By contrast, if trade and geopolitical 
tensions were resolved swiftly, this could lift sentiment and spur activity. A further increase in defence 
and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would also add to growth.  
The outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual, as a result of the volatile global trade 
policy environment. Falling energy prices and a stronger euro could put further downward pressure on  
 
inflation. This could be reinforced if higher tariffs led to lower demand for euro area exports and to 
countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area. Trade tensions could lead to 
greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets, which would weigh on domestic demand and 
would thereby also lower inflation. By contrast, a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise 
inflation by pushing up import prices and adding to capacity constraints in the domestic economy. A 
boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term. Extreme 
weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than 
expected.
