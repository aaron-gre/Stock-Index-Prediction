Inflation
Annual inflation declined to 1.9 per cent in May, from 2.2 per cent in April, according to Eurostat’s flash 
estimate. Energy price inflation remained at -3.6 per cent. Food price inflation rose to 3.3 per cent, 
from 3.0 per cent the month before. Goods inflation was unchanged at 0.6 per cent, while services 
inflation dropped to 3.2 per cent, from 4.0 per cent in April. Services inflation had jumped in April 
mainly because prices for travel services around the Easter holidays went up by more than expected.  
Most indicators of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will stabilise sustainably at our two per cent 
medium-term target. Labour costs are gradually moderating, as indicated by incoming data on 
negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee. The ECB’s wage 
tracker points to a further easing of negotiated wage growth in 2025, while the staff projections see 
wage growth falling to below 3 per cent in 2026 and 2027. While lower energy prices and a stronger 
euro are putting downward pressure on inflation in the near term, inflation is expected to return to 
target in 2027. 
Short-term consumer inflation expectations edged up in April, likely reflecting news about trade 
tensions. But most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per 
cent, which supports the stabilisation of inflation around our target.
