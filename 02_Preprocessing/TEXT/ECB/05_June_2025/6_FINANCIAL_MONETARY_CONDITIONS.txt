Financial and monetary conditions
Risk-free interest rates have remained broadly unchanged since our last meeting. Equity prices have 
risen, and corporate bond spreads have narrowed, in response to more positive news about global 
trade policies and the improvement in global risk sentiment. 
Our past interest rate cuts continue to make corporate borrowing less expensive. The average interest 
rate on new loans to firms declined to 3.8 per cent in April, from 3.9 per cent in March. The cost of 
issuing market-based debt was unchanged at 3.7 per cent. Bank lending to firms continued to 
strengthen gradually, growing by an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in April after 2.4 per cent in March, 
while corporate bond issuance was subdued. The average interest rate on new mortgages stayed at 
3.3 per cent in April, while growth in mortgage lending increased to 1.9 per cent. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. While euro area banks remain resilient, broader 
financial stability risks remain elevated, in particular owing to highly uncertain and volatile global trade 
policies. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build- up of financial 
vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space.
