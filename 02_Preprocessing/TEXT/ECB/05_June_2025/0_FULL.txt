Combined monetary policy decisions and 
statement 
5 June 2025  
Monetary policy decisions 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council 
steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the 
dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.  
Inflation is currently at around the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target. In the baseline of the 
new Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation is set to average 2.0% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026 and 
2.0% in 2027. The downward revisions compared with the March projections, by 0.3 percentage points 
for both 2025 and 2026, mainly reflect lower assumptions for energy prices and a stronger euro. Staff 
expect inflation excluding energy and food to average 2.4% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026 and 2027, 
broadly unchanged since March.  
Staff see real GDP growth averaging 0.9% in 2025, 1.1% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. The unrevised 
growth projection for 2025 reflects a stronger than expected first quarter combined with weaker 
prospects for the remainder of the year. While the uncertainty surrounding trade policies is expected to 
weigh on business investment and exports, especially in the short term, rising government investment 
in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term. Higher real 
incomes and a robust labour market will allow households to spend more. Together with  more 
favourable financing conditions, this should make the economy more resilient to global shocks. 
In the context of high uncertainty, staff also assessed some of the mechanisms by which different 
trade policies could affect growth and inflation under some alternative illustrative scenarios. These 
scenarios will be published with the staff projections on the ECB’s website. Under this scenario 
analysis, a further escalation of trade tensions over the coming months would result in growth and 
inflation being below the baseline projections. By contrast, if trade tensions were resolved with a  
 
benign outcome, growth and, to a lesser extent, inflation would be higher than in the baseline 
projections. 
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing 
Council’s 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth is still elevated but continues to 
moderate visibly, and profits are partially buffering its impact on inflation. The concerns that increased 
uncertainty and a volatile market response to the trade tensions in April would have a tightening 
impact on financing conditions have eased. 
The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-
term target. Especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, it will follow a data- dependent 
and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. The 
Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in 
light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength 
of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. 
Key ECB interest rates 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. 
Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal 
lending facility will be decreased to 2.00%, 2.15% and 2.40% respectively, with effect from 11 June 
2025. 
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) 
The APP and PEPP portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem 
no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. 
*** 
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that 
inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth 
functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is 
available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the 
transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to 
more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.  
 
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press 
conference starting at 14:45 CET today. 
   
 
Monetary policy statement 
Press conference 
Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, 
Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB 
Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. 
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. 
Inflation is currently at around our two per cent medium-term target. In the baseline of the new 
Eurosystem staff projections, headline inflation is set to average 2.0 per cent in 2025, 1.6 per cent in 
2026 and 2.0 per cent in 2027. The downward revisions compared with the March projections, by 0.3 
percentage points for both 2025 and 2026, mainly reflect lower assumptions for energy prices and a 
stronger euro. Staff expect inflation excluding energy and food to average 2.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.9 
per cent in 2026 and 2027, broadly unchanged since March.  
Staff see real GDP growth averaging 0.9 per cent in 2025, 1.1 per cent in 2026 and 1.3 per cent in 
2027. The unrevised growth projection for 2025 reflects a stronger than expected first quarter 
combined with weaker prospects for the remainder of the year. While the uncertainty surrounding 
trade policies is expected to weigh on business investment and exports, especially in the short term, 
rising government investment in defence and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the 
medium term. Higher real incomes and a robust labour market will allow households to spend more. 
Together with more favourable financing conditions, this should make the economy more resilient to 
global shocks. 
In the context of high uncertainty, staff also assessed some of the mechanisms by which different 
trade policies could affect growth and inflation under some alternative illustrative scenarios. These 
scenarios will be published with the staff projections on our website. Under this scenario analysis, a 
further escalation of trade tensions over the coming months would result in growth and inflation being 
below the baseline projections. By contrast, if trade tensions were resolved with a benign outcome, 
growth and, to a lesser extent, inflation would be higher than in the baseline projections. 
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around our two per cent 
medium-term target on a sustained basis. Wage growth is still elevated but continues to moderate  
 
visibly, and profits are partially buffering its impact on inflation. The concerns that increased 
uncertainty and a volatile market response to the trade tensions in April would have a tightening 
impact on financing conditions have eased. 
We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium- term 
target. Especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will follow a data- dependent and 
meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. O ur interest rate 
decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic 
and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path.  
The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.  
I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain 
our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. 
Economic activity 
The economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2025, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. 
Unemployment, at 6.2 per cent in April, is at its lowest level since the launch of the euro, and 
employment grew by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year, according to the flash estimate.  
In line with the staff projections, survey data point overall to some weaker prospects in the near term. 
While manufacturing has strengthened, partly because trade has been brought forward in anticipation 
of higher tariffs, the more domestically oriented services sector is slowing. Higher tariffs and a stronger 
euro are expected to make it harder for firms to export. High uncertainty is expected to weigh on 
investment. 
At the same time, several factors are keeping the economy resilient and should support growth over 
the medium term. A strong labour market, rising real incomes, robust private sector balance sheets 
and easier financing conditions, in part because of our past interest rate cuts, should all help 
consumers and firms withstand the fallout from a volatile global environment. Recently announced 
measures to step up defence and infrastructure investment should also bolster growth.  
In the present geopolitical environment, it is even more urgent for fiscal and structural policies to make 
the euro area economy more productive, competitive and resilient. The European Commission’s 
Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on 
simplification, should be swiftly adopted. This includes completing the savings and investment union, 
following a clear and ambitious timetable. It is also important to rapidly establish the legislative  
 
framework to prepare the ground for the potential introduction of a digital euro. G overnments should 
ensure sustainable public finances in line with the EU’s economic governance framework, while 
prioritising essential growth-enhancing structural reforms and strategic investment. 
Inflation 
Annual inflation declined to 1.9 per cent in May, from 2.2 per cent in April, according to Eurostat’s flash 
estimate. Energy price inflation remained at -3.6 per cent. Food price inflation rose to 3.3 per cent, 
from 3.0 per cent the month before. Goods inflation was unchanged at 0.6 per cent, while services 
inflation dropped to 3.2 per cent, from 4.0 per cent in April. Services inflation had jumped in April 
mainly because prices for travel services around the Easter holidays went up by more than expected.  
Most indicators of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will stabilise sustainably at our two per cent 
medium-term target. Labour costs are gradually moderating, as indicated by incoming data on 
negotiated wages and available country data on compensation per employee. The ECB’s wage 
tracker points to a further easing of negotiated wage growth in 2025, while the staff projections see 
wage growth falling to below 3 per cent in 2026 and 2027. While lower energy prices and a stronger 
euro are putting downward pressure on inflation in the near term, inflation is expected to return to 
target in 2027. 
Short-term consumer inflation expectations edged up in April, likely reflecting news about trade 
tensions. But most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per 
cent, which supports the stabilisation of inflation around our target. 
Risk assessment  
Risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation in global trade tensions 
and associated uncertainties could lower euro area growth by dampening exports  and dragging down 
investment and consumption. A deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter 
financing conditions and greater risk aversion, and make firms and households less willing to invest 
and consume. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic 
conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty. By contrast, if trade and geopolitical 
tensions were resolved swiftly, this could lift sentiment and spur activity. A further increase in defence 
and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would also add to growth.  
The outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual, as a result of the volatile global trade 
policy environment. Falling energy prices and a stronger euro could put further downward pressure on  
 
inflation. This could be reinforced if higher tariffs led to lower demand for euro area exports and to 
countries with overcapacity rerouting their exports to the euro area. Trade tensions could lead to 
greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets, which would weigh on domestic demand and 
would thereby also lower inflation. By contrast, a fragmentation of global supply chains could raise 
inflation by pushing up import prices and adding to capacity constraints in the domestic economy. A 
boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term. Extreme 
weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than 
expected.  
Financial and monetary conditions 
Risk-free interest rates have remained broadly unchanged since our last meeting. Equity prices have 
risen, and corporate bond spreads have narrowed, in response to more positive news about global 
trade policies and the improvement in global risk sentiment. 
Our past interest rate cuts continue to make corporate borrowing less expensive. The average interest 
rate on new loans to firms declined to 3.8 per cent in April, from 3.9 per cent in March. The cost of 
issuing market-based debt was unchanged at 3.7 per cent. Bank lending to firms continued to 
strengthen gradually, growing by an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in April after 2.4 per cent in March, 
while corporate bond issuance was subdued. The average interest rate on new mortgages stayed at 
3.3 per cent in April, while growth in mortgage lending increased to 1.9 per cent. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. While euro area banks remain resilient, broader 
financial stability risks remain elevated, in particular owing to highly uncertain and volatile global trade 
policies. Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence against the build- up of financial 
vulnerabilities, enhancing resilience and preserving macroprudential space.  
Conclusion  
The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In 
particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary 
policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are determined to ensure 
that inflation stabilises sustainably at our two per cent medium-term target. Especially in current 
conditions of exceptional uncertainty, we will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting 
approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. Our interest rate decisions will be  
 
based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, 
the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.  We are not pre-
committing to a particular rate path. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary 
policy transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
