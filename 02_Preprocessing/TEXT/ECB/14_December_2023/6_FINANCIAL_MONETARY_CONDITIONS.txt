Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have fallen markedly since our last meeting and lie below the rates embedded in 
the staff projections. Our restrictive monetary policy continues to transmit strongly into broader 
financing conditions. Lending rates rose again in October, to 5.3 per cent for business loans and 3.9 
per cent for mortgages. 
Higher borrowing rates, subdued loan demand and tighter loan supply have further weakened credit 
dynamics. Loans to firms declined at an annual rate of 0.3 per cent in October and loans to 
households also remained subdued, growing at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent. With weaker lending 
and the reduction in the Eurosystem balance sheet, broad money – as measured by M3 – has 
continued to contract. In October it fell at an annual rate of 1.0 per cent. 
In line with our monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council thoroughly assessed the links 
between monetary policy and financial stability. Euro area banks have demonstrated their resilience. 
They have high capital ratios and have become significantly more profitable over the past year. But 
the financial stability outlook remains fragile in the current environment of tightening financing 
conditions, weak growth and geopolitical tensions. In particular, the situation could worsen if banks’ 
funding costs were to increase by more than expected and if more borrowers were to struggle to repay 
their loans. At the same time, the overall impact of such a scenario on the economy should be 
contained if financial markets react in an orderly fashion. Macroprudential policy remains the first line 
of defence against the build-up of financial vulnerabilities, and the measures in place contribute to 
preserving the financial system’s resilience.
