Economic activity
The euro area economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, mostly owing to a decline in 
inventories. Tighter financing conditions and subdued foreign demand are likely to continue weighing 
on economic activity in the near term. Prospects are especially weak for construction and 
manufacturing, the two sectors most affected by higher interest rates. Services activity is also set to 
soften in the coming months. This is due to spillovers from weaker industrial activity, fading effects 
from the reopening of the economy and the broadening impact of tighter financing conditions. 
The labour market continues to support the economy. The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 per cent in 
October and employment grew by 0.2 per cent over the third quarter. At the same time, the weaker 
economy is dampening the demand for workers, with firms advertising fewer vacancies in recent 
months. Moreover, even though more people are in work, the total number of hours worked edged 
down by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter.  
As the energy crisis fades, governments should continue to roll back the related support measures. 
This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which would otherwise call for 
even tighter monetary policy. Fiscal policies should be designed to make our economy more 
productive and to gradually bring down high public debt. Structural reforms and investments to 
enhance the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be supported by the full implementation of the 
Next Generation EU programme – can help reduce price pressures in the medium term, while 
supporting the green and digital transitions. To that end, it is important to swiftly agree on the reform of 
the EU’s economic governance framework. Moreover, it is imperative that progress towards Capital 
Markets Union and the completion of Banking Union be accelerated.
