Inflation
Inflation dropped over the past two months, falling to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in November 
according to Eurostatâ€™s flash release. This decline was broad-based. Energy price inflation fell further 
and food price inflation also came down, despite remaining relatively high overall. This month, inflation 
is likely to pick up on account of an upward base effect for the cost of energy. In 2024, we expect 
inflation to decline more slowly because of further upward base effects and the phasing-out of past 
fiscal measures aimed at limiting the repercussions of the energy price shock. 
Inflation excluding energy and food dropped by almost a full percentage point over the past two 
months, falling to 3.6 per cent in November. This reflects improving supply conditions, the fading 
effects of the past energy shock and the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and on the 
pricing power of firms. The inflation rates for goods and services fell to 2.9 per cent and 4.0 per cent 
respectively. 
All measures of underlying inflation declined in October, but domestic price pressures remained 
elevated, chiefly because of strong wage growth together with falling productivity. Measures of longer-
term inflation expectations mostly stand around 2 per cent, with some market-based indicators of 
inflation compensation declining from elevated levels.
