Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of 
monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in 
global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the 
tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and 
households becoming less confident about the future. Growth could be higher if rising real incomes 
raise spending by more than anticipated, or the world economy grows more strongly than ex pected. 
Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, which could raise energy prices 
in the near term, and extreme weather events, which could drive up food prices. Inflation could also 
turn out higher than anticipated if inflation expectations were to move above our target, or if wages or 
profit margins increased by more than expected. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if 
monetary policy dampens demand by more than expected or the economic environment in the rest of 
the world worsens unexpectedly, potentially owing in part to the recent rise in geopolitical risks.
