Financial and monetary conditions
As we tighten monetary policy, borrowing is becoming more expensive for firms and households. Bank 
lending to firms remains robust, as firms replace bonds with bank loans and use credit to finance the 
higher costs of production and investment. Households are borrowing less, because of tighter credit 
standards, rising interest rates, worsening prospects for the housing market and lower consumer 
confidence.  
In line with our monetary policy strategy, twice a year the Governing Council assesses in depth the 
interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability. The financial stability environment has 
deteriorated since our last review in June 2022 owing to a weaker economy and rising credit risk. In 
addition, sovereign vulnerabilities have risen amid the weaker economic outlook and weaker  fiscal 
positions. Tighter financing conditions would mitigate the build-up of financial vulnerabilities and lower 
tail risks to inflation over the medium term, at the cost of a higher risk of systemic stress and greater 
downside risks to growth in the short term. In addition, the liquidity needs of non-bank financial 
institutions may amplify market volatility. At the same time, euro area banks have comfor table levels of 
capital, which helps to reduce the side effects of tighter monetary policy on financial stability. 
Macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing 
medium-term vulnerabilities.
