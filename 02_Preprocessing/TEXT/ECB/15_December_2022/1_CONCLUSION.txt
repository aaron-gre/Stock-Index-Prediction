Conclusion
Summing up, we have today raised the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based on 
the substantial upward revision to our inflation outlook, we expect to raise them further. In particular, 
we judge that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are 
sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. 
Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and 
will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. Moreover, f rom the 
beginning of March 2023 onwards, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, 
as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities.    
 
Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and determined meeting by 
meeting. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term inflation target. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
