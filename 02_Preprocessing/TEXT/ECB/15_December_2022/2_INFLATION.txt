Inflation
Inflation declined to 10.0 per cent in November, mainly on the back of lower energy price inflation, 
while services inflation also edged down. Food price inflation rose further to 13.6 per cent, however, 
as high input costs in food production were passed through to consumer prices. 
Price pressures remain strong across sectors, partly as a result of the impact of high energy costs 
throughout the economy. Inflation excluding energy and food was unchanged in November, at 5.0 per 
cent, and other measures of underlying inflation are also high. Fiscal measures to compensate 
households for high energy prices and inflation are set to dampen inflation over next year but will raise 
it once they are withdrawn. 
Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, although their effects are still contributing to inflation, pushing 
up goods prices in particular. The same holds true for the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions: while 
weakening, the effect of pent-up demand is still driving up prices, especially in the services sector. The 
depreciation of the euro this year is also continuing to feed through to consumer prices. 
Wage growth is strengthening, supported by robust labour markets and some catch- up in wages to 
compensate workers for high inflation. As these factors are set to remain in place, the Eurosystem 
staff projections see wages growing at rates well above historical averages and pushing up inflation 
throughout the projection period. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand 
at around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued 
monitoring.
