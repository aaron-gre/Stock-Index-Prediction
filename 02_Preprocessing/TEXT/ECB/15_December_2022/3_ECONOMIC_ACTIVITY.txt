Economic activity
Economic growth in the euro area slowed to 0.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year. High inflation 
and tighter financing conditions are dampening spending and production by reducing real household 
incomes and pushing up costs for firms. 
The world economy is also slowing, in a context of continued geopolitical uncertainty, especially owing 
to Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people, and tighter financing conditions worldwide. 
The past deterioration in the terms of trade, reflecting the faster rise in import prices than in export 
prices, continues to weigh on purchasing power in the euro area. 
On the positive side, employment increased by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, and unemployment hit 
a new historical low of 6.5 per cent in October. Rising wages are set to restore some lost purchasing 
power, supporting consumption. As the economy weakens, however, job creation is likely to slow, and 
unemployment could rise over the coming quarters.  
Fiscal support measures to shield the economy from the impact of high energy prices should be 
temporary, targeted and tailored to preserving incentives to consume less energy. Fiscal measures 
falling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures , which would necessitate 
a stronger monetary policy response. Moreover, in line with the EU’s economic governance 
framework, fiscal policies should be oriented towards making our economy more productive and 
gradually bringing down high public debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s s upply capacity,  
 
especially in the energy sector, can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. To that end, 
governments should swiftly implement their investment and structural reform plans under the Next 
Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be 
concluded rapidly.
