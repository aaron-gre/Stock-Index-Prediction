Risk assessment
Risks to the economic growth outlook are on the downside, especially in the near term. The war 
against Ukraine remains a significant downside risk to the economy. Energy and food costs could also 
remain persistently higher than expected. There could be an additional drag on growth in the euro 
area if the world economy were to weaken more sharply than we expect. 
The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the near term, existing pipeline 
pressures could lead to stronger than expected rises in retail prices for energy and food. Over the  
 
medium term, risks stem primarily from domestic factors such as a persistent rise in inflation 
expectations above our target or higher than anticipated wage rises. By contrast, a decline in energy 
costs or a further weakening of demand would lower price pressures.
