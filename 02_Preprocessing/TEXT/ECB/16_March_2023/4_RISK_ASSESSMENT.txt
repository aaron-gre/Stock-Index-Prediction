Risk assessment
Risks to the outlook for economic growth are tilted to the downside. Persistently elevated financial 
market tensions could tighten broader credit conditions more strongly than expected and dampen 
confidence. Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and its people continues to be a significant 
downside risk to the economy and could again push up the costs of energy and food. There could also 
be an additional drag on euro area growth if the world economy weakened more sharply than 
expected. However, companies could adapt more quickly to the challenging international environment 
and, together with the fading-out of the energy shock, this could support higher growth than currently 
expected. 
The upside risks to inflation include existing pipeline pressures that could still send retail prices even 
higher than expected in the near term. Domestic factors, such as a persistent rise in inflation 
expectations above our target or higher than anticipated increases in wages and profit margins , could 
drive inflation higher, including over the medium term. Moreover, a stronger than expected economic 
rebound in China could give a fresh boost to commodity prices and foreign demand. T he downside 
risks to inflation include persistently elevated financial market tensions that could accelerate 
disinflation. In addition, falling energy prices could translate into reduced pressure from underlying  
 
inflation and wages. A weakening of demand, including owing to a stronger deceleration of bank credit 
or a stronger than projected transmission of monetary policy, would also contribute to lower price 
pressures than currently anticipated, especially over the medium term.
