Conclusion
Summing up, inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Council 
today decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with our 
determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium- term target. The 
elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to our policy rate 
decisions, which will be determined by our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming 
economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy 
transmission. We are monitoring current market tensions closely and stand ready to respond as 
necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. 
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
