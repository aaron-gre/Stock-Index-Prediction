Inflation
Inflation edged down to 8.5 per cent in February. The decline resulted from a renewed sharp drop in 
energy prices. By contrast, food price inflation increased further, to 15.0 per cent, with the past surge 
in the cost of energy and of other inputs for food production still feeding through to consumer  prices.  
Moreover, underlying price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food increased to 
5.6 per cent in February and other indicators of underlying inflation have also stayed high. Non-energy 
industrial goods inflation rose to 6.8 per cent in February, mainly reflecting the delayed effects of past 
supply bottlenecks and high energy prices. Services inflation, which rose to 4.8 per cent in February, 
is also still being driven by the gradual pass-through of past energy cost increases, pent-up demand 
from the reopening of the economy and rising wages.  
Wage pressures have strengthened on the back of robust labour markets and employees aiming to 
recoup some of the purchasing power lost owing to high inflation. Moreover, many firms were able to 
raise their profit margins in sectors faced with constrained supply and resurgent demand. At the same 
time, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, 
although they warrant continued monitoring, especially in light of recent volatility in market -based 
inflation expectations.
