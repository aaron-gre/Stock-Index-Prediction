Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates rose considerably in the weeks following our last meeting. But the increase has 
strongly reversed over recent days in a context of severe financial market tensions. Bank credit to 
euro area firms has become more expensive. Credit to firms has weakened further, owing to lower 
demand and tighter credit supply conditions. Household borrowing has become more expensive as 
well, especially owing to higher mortgage rates. This rise in borrowing costs and the resultant decline 
in demand, along with tighter credit standards, have led to a further slowdown in the growth of loans to 
households. Amid these weaker loan dynamics, money growth has slowed sharply, driven by its most 
liquid components.
