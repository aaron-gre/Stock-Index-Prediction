Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have increased in anticipation of further monetary policy normalisation in 
response to the inflation outlook. Credit to firms has become more expensive over recent months, and 
bank lending rates for households now stand at their highest levels in more than five years. In terms of 
volumes, bank lending to firms has so far remained strong, in part reflecting the need to finance high 
production costs and inventory building. Mortgage lending to households is moderating because of 
tightening credit standards, rising borrowing costs and weak consumer confidence .
