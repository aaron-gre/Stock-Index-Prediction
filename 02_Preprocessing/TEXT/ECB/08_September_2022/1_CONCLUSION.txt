Conclusion
Summing up, we raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points today, and expect to raise 
interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an 
extended period. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative 
level of policy rates towards levels that will support a timely return of inflation to our two per cent 
medium-term target.  
Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting 
approach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term inflation target. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
