Risk assessment
In the context of the slowing global economy, risks to growth are primarily on the downside, in 
particular in the near term. As reflected in the downside scenario in the staff projections, a long-lasting 
war in Ukraine remains a significant risk to growth, especially if firms and households faced rationing 
of energy supplies. In such a situation, confidence could deteriorate further and supply-side 
constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also remain persistently higher than 
expected. A further deterioration in the global economic outlook could be an additional drag on euro 
area external demand. 
The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the same way as for growth, the major 
risk in the short term is a further disruption of energy supplies. Over the medium term, inflation may 
turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of 
the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if energy costs were to decline or 
demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.
