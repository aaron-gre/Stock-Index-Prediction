Risk assessment
The incoming data confirm that risks to the economic growth outlook are clearly on the downside, 
especially in the near term. A long-lasting war in Ukraine remains a significant risk. Confidence could 
deteriorate further and supply-side constraints could worsen again. Energy and food costs could also 
remain persistently higher than expected. A weakening world economy could be an additional drag on 
growth in the euro area. 
The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term is a 
further rise in retail energy prices. Over the medium term, inflation may turn out to be higher than 
expected if there are increases in the prices of energy and food commodities and a stronger pass-
through to consumer prices, a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area 
economy, a persistent rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wage 
rises. By contrast, a decline in energy costs and a further weakening of demand would lower price 
pressures.
