Economic activity
The near-term economic outlook for the euro area has deteriorated, owing largely to weaker domestic 
demand. High inflation and tighter financing conditions are dampening spending. This is weighing 
especially on manufacturing output, which is also being held down by weak external demand. Housing 
and business investment are showing signs of weakness as well. Services remain more resilient, 
especially in contact-intensive subsectors such as tourism. But momentum is slowing in the services 
sector. The economy is expected to remain weak in the short run. Over time, falling inflation, rising 
incomes and improving supply conditions should support the recovery. 
The labour market remains robust. The unemployment rate stayed at its historical low of 6.5 per cent 
in May and many new jobs are being created, especially in the services sector. At the same time, 
forward-looking indicators suggest that this trend might slow down in the coming months and may turn 
negative for manufacturing. 
As the energy crisis fades, governments should roll back the related support measures promptly and 
in a concerted manner. This is essential to avoid driving up medium-term inflationary pressures, which 
would otherwise call for a stronger monetary policy response. We welcome the recent Eurogroup 
statement on the euro area fiscal stance, which is consistent with this assessment. Fiscal policies 
should be designed to make our economy more productive and to gradually bring down high public 
debt. Policies to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in the 
medium term, while supporting the green transition, which is also being furthered by the Next 
Generation EU programme. The reform of the EU’s economic governance framework should be 
concluded before the end of this year.
