Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of
monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy would also weigh on
growth. Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict triggered by the terrorist attacks
in Israel are key sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and households becoming less
confident and more uncertain about the future, and dampen growth further. Conversely, growth could
be higher than expected if the still resilient labour market and rising real incomes mean that people

Upside risks to inflation could come from higher energy and food costs. The heightened geopolitical
tensions could drive up energy prices in the near term, while making the medium-term outlook more
uncertain. Extreme weather, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could push food prices up
by more than expected. A lasting rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than
anticipated increases in wages or profit margins, could also drive inflation higher, including over the
medium term. By contrast, weaker demand – for example owing to a stronger transmission of
monetary policy or a worsening of the economic environment in the rest of the world amid greater
geopolitical risks – would ease price pressures, especially over the medium term.
