Financial and monetary conditions
Bank funding costs are increasing in response to the rise in market interest rates. Borrowing has also 
become more expensive for firms and households. Bank lending to firms remains robust, as they need 
to finance high production costs and build up inventories. At the same time, demand for loans to 
finance investment has continued to decline. Lending to households is moderating, as credit standards  
 
have tightened and demand for loans has decreased in a context of rising interest rates and low 
consumer confidence. 
Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories in 
the third quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the deter iorating outlook 
for the economy and the risks faced by their customers in the current environment. Banks expect to 
continue tightening their credit standards in the fourth quarter.
