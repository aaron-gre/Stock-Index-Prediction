Conclusion
Summing up, today we have raised the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, and expect to 
raise interest rates further, to ensure the timely return of inflation to our medium-term target. With this 
third major policy rate increase in a row, we have made substantial progress in withdrawing monetary 
policy accommodation. The changes to the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-term 
refinancing operations will also contribute to the ongoing policy normalisation process. 
Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting 
approach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term inflation target. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
