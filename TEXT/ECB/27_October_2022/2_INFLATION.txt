Inflation
Inflation rose to 9.9 per cent in September, reflecting further increases in all components. Energy price 
inflation, at 40.7 per cent, remained the main driver of overall inflation, with an increasing contribution 
from gas and electricity prices. Food price inflation also rose further, to 11.8 per cent, as high input 
costs made food production more expensive.  
 
Supply bottlenecks are gradually easing, though their lagged impact is still contributing to inflation. T he 
impact of pent-up demand, while weakening, is still driving up prices in the services sector. The 
depreciation of the euro has added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. 
Price pressures are evident in more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs 
feeding through to the whole economy. Measures of underlying inflation have thus remained at 
elevated levels. Among those measures, inflation excluding energy and food rose further to 4.8 per 
cent in September. 
Strong labour markets are likely to support higher wages, as is some catch-up in wages to 
compensate for higher inflation. Incoming wage data and recent wage agreements indicate that the 
growth of wages may be picking up. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently 
stand at around two per cent, although further above-target revisions to some indicators warrant 
continued monitoring.
