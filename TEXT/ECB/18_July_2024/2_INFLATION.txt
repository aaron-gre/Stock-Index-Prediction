Inflation
Annual inflation eased to 2.5 per cent in June, from 2.6 per cent in May. Food prices  went up by 2.4 
per cent in June – which is 0.2 percentage points less than in May – while energy prices remained 
essentially flat. Both goods price inflation and services price inflation were unchanged in June, at 0.7% 
and 4.1% respectively. While some measures of underlying inflation ticked up in May owing to one- off 
factors, most measures were either stable or edged down in June. 
Domestic inflation remains high. Wages are still rising at an elevated rate, making up for the past 
period of high inflation. Higher nominal wages, alongside weak productivity, have added to unit labour 
cost growth, although it decelerated somewhat in the first quarter of this year. Owing to the staggered 
nature of wage adjustments and the large contribution of one-off payments, growth in labour costs will 
likely remain elevated over the near term. At the same time, recent data on compensation per 
employee have been in line with expectations and the latest survey indicators signal that wage growth 
will moderate over the course of next year. Moreover, profits contracted in the first quarter, helping to 
offset the inflationary effects of higher unit labour costs, and survey evidence suggests that profits 
should continue to be dampened in the near term.  
 
Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the rest of the year, partly owing to energy-
related base effects. It is then expected to decline towards our target over the second half of next 
year, owing to weaker growth in labour costs, the effects of our restrictive monetary policy and the 
fading impact of the past inflation surge. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained broadly stable, with most standing at around 2 per cent.
