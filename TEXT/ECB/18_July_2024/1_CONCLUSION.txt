Conclusion
The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. We are 
determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. 
We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will 
continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate 
level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our 
assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics 
of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre- committing to 
a particular rate path.  
In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation 
returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy 
transmission. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
