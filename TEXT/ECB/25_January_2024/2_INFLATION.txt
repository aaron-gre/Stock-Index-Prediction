Inflation
Inflation rose to 2.9 per cent in December as some of the past fiscal measures to cushion the impact 
of high energy prices dropped out of the annual inflation rate, although the rebound was weaker than 
expected. Aside from this base effect, the overall trend of declining inflation continued. Food price 
inflation dropped to 6.1 per cent in December. Inflation excluding energy and food also declined again, 
to 3.4 per cent, due to a fall in goods inflation to 2.5 per cent. Services inflation was stable at 4.0 per 
cent. 
Inflation is expected to ease further over the course of this year as the effects of past energy shocks, 
supply bottlenecks and the post-pandemic reopening of the economy fade, and tighter monetary policy 
continues to weigh on demand.  
Almost all measures of underlying inflation declined further in December. The elevated rate of wage 
increases and falling labour productivity are keeping domestic price pressures high, although these 
too have started to ease. At the same time, lower unit profits have started to moderate the inflationary 
effect of rising unit labour costs. Measures of shorter-term inflation expectations have come down 
markedly, while those of longer-term inflation expectations mostly stand around 2 per cent.
