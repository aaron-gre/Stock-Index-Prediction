Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have moved broadly sideways since our last meeting. Our restrictive monetary 
policy continues to transmit strongly into broader financing conditions. Lending rates on business 
loans declined slightly, to 5.2 per cent in November, while mortgage rates increased further to 4.0 per 
cent. 
High borrowing rates, with the associated cutbacks in investment plans and house purchases, led to a 
further drop in credit demand in the fourth quarter, as reported in our latest bank lending survey. While 
the tightening of credit standards for loans to firms and households moderated, they remained tight, 
with banks concerned about the risks faced by their customers. 
Against this background, credit dynamics have improved somewhat but overall remain weak. Loans to 
firms stagnated in November compared with a year earlier – after contracting in October – as the 
monthly flow of short-term loans rebounded. Loans to households grew at a subdued annual rate of 
0.5 per cent.
