Economic activity
The euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of 2023. The incoming data 
continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward-looking survey indicators point 
to a pick-up in growth further ahead.  
 
The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate, at 6.4 per cent in November, has 
fallen back to its lowest level since the start of the euro and more workers have entered the labour 
force. At the same time, demand for labour is slowing, with fewer vacancies being advertised. 
Governments should continue to roll back energy-related support measures to avoid driving up 
medium-term inflationary pressures. Fiscal and structural policies should be designed to make our 
economy more productive and competitive, as well as to gradually bring down high public debt ratios. 
Structural reforms and investments to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity – which would be 
supported by the full implementation of the Next Generation EU programme – can help reduce price 
pressures in the medium term, while supporting the green and digital transitions. Following the recent 
ECOFIN Council agreement on the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework, the 
legislative process should be concluded swiftly so that the new rules can be implemented without 
delay. Moreover, it is imperative that progress towards Capital Markets Union and the completion of 
Banking Union be accelerated.
