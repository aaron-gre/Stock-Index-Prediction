Risk assessment
The risks to economic growth remain tilted to the downside. Growth could be lower if the effects of 
monetary policy turn out stronger than expected. A weaker world economy or a further slowdown in 
global trade would also weigh on euro area growth. Russiaâ€™s unjustified war against Ukraine and the 
tragic conflict in the Middle East are key sources of geopolitical risk. This may result in firms and 
households becoming less confident about the future and global trade being disrupted. Growth could 
be higher if rising real incomes mean spending increases by more than anticipated, or if the world 
economy grows more strongly than expected. 
Upside risks to inflation include the heightened geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, 
which could push energy prices and freight costs higher in the near term and hamper global trade. 
Inflation could also turn out higher than anticipated if wages increase by more than expected or profit 
margins prove more resilient. By contrast, inflation may surprise on the downside if monetary policy 
dampens demand by more than expected, or if the economic environment in the rest of the world 
worsens unexpectedly. Moreover, inflation could decline more quickly in the near term if energy prices 
evolve in line with the recent downward shift in market expectations of the future path for oil and gas 
prices.
