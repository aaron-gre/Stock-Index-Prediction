Financial and monetary conditions
Market interest rates have been volatile as a result of the pronounced economic and geopolitical 
uncertainty. Bank funding costs have risen in recent months, which has increasingly fed into higher  
 
bank lending rates, in particular for households. While the volume of bank lending to households 
remains strong, it is expected to decline in view of lower demand. Lending to firms has also been 
robust as high production costs, inventory building and lower reliance on market funding have created 
a continued need for credit from banks. At the same time, demand for loans to finance investment has 
declined. Money growth has continued to moderate owing to lower liquid savings and lower 
Eurosystem asset purchases. 
Our most recent bank lending survey reports that credit standards tightened for all loan categories  in 
the second quarter of the year, as banks are becoming more concerned about the risks faced by their 
customers in the current uncertain environment. Banks expect to continue tightening their credit 
standards in the third quarter.
