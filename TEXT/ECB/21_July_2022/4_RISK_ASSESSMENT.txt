Risk assessment
A prolongation of the war in Ukraine remains a source of significant downside risk to growth, 
especially if energy supplies from Russia were to be disrupted to such an extent that it led to rationing 
for firms and households. The war may also further dampen confidence and aggravate supply-side 
constraints, while energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected. A faster 
deceleration in global growth would also pose a risk to the euro area outlook.  
The risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and have intensified, particularly in the 
short term. The risks to the medium-term inflation outlook include a durable worsening of the 
production capacity of our economy, persistently high energy and food prices, inflation expectations 
rising above our target and higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if demand were to weaken 
over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices.
