Conclusion
Summing up, inflation continues to be undesirably high and is expected to remain above our target for 
some time. The latest data indicate a slowdown in growth, clouding the outlook for the second half of 
2022 and beyond. At the same time, this slowdown is being cushioned by a number of supportive 
factors.  
The Governing Council has today decided to raise the key ECB interest rates and approved the TPI. 
At our upcoming meetings, further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate. O ur future policy 
rate path will continue to be data-dependent and will help us deliver on our two per cent inflation target 
over the medium term.  
We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at 
our two per cent target over the medium term. Our new TPI will safeguard the smooth transmission of 
our monetary policy stance throughout the euro area as we keep adjusting the stance to address high 
inflation. 
We are now ready to take your questions.
