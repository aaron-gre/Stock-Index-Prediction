Economic activity
The economy stagnated in the fourth quarter, according to Eurostat’s preliminary flash estimate. It is 
set to remain weak in the near term. Surveys indicate that manufacturing continues to contract while 
services activity is expanding. Consumer confidence is fragile, and households have not yet drawn 
sufficient encouragement from rising real incomes to significantly increase their spending.  
Nevertheless, the conditions for a recovery remain in place. While the labour market has softened 
over recent months it continues to be robust, with the unemployment rate staying low, at 6.3 per cent 
in December. A solid job market and higher incomes should strengthen consumer confidence and 
allow spending to rise. More affordable credit should also boost consumption and investment over 
time. Provided trade tensions do not escalate, exports should support the recovery as global demand 
rises. 
Fiscal and structural policies should make the economy more productive, competitive and resilient. We 
welcome the European Commission’s Competitiveness Compass, which provides a concrete roadmap 
for action. It is crucial to follow up, with further concrete and ambitious structural policies, on Mario 
Draghi’s proposals for enhancing European competitiveness and on Enrico Letta’s proposals for 
empowering the Single Market. Governments should implement their commitments under the EU’s 
economic governance framework fully and without delay. This will help bring down budget deficits and 
debt ratios on a sustained basis, while prioritising growth-enhancing reforms and investment.
