Inflation
Annual inflation increased to 2.4 per cent in December, up from 2.2 per cent in November. As in the 
previous two months, the increase was expected and primarily reflected past sharp drops in energy 
prices falling out of the calculation. Along with a month-on-month increase in December, this led 
energy prices slightly higher on an annual basis, after four consecutive declines. Food price inflation 
edged down to 2.6 per cent and goods inflation to 0.5 per cent. Services inflation edged up to 4.0 per 
cent. 
Most underlying inflation indicators have been developing in line with a sustained return of inflation to 
our medium-term target. Domestic inflation, which closely tracks services inflation, has remained high, 
as wages and some services prices are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial 
delay. At the same time, recent signals point to continued moderation in wage pressures and to the 
buffering role of profits. 
We expect inflation to fluctuate around its current level in the near term. It should then settle 
sustainably at around the two per cent medium-term target. Easing labour cost pressures and the  
 
continuing impact of our past monetary policy tightening on consumer prices should help this process. 
While market-based indicators of inflation compensation have largely reversed the declines observed 
in the autumn, most measures of longer-term inflation expectations continue to stand at around 2 per 
cent.
